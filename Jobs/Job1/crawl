/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats.

XML&#8482; is the shorthand name for Extensible Markup Language [XML]. While retaining these beneficial features, XML removes many of the more complex features of SGML that make the authoring and design of suitable software both difficult and costly. The benefits of migrating to XHTML 1.0 are described above. Some of the benefits of migrating to XHTML in general are: This section is normative. This section is normative. A Strictly Conforming XHTML Document is an XML document that requires only the facilities described as mandatory in this specification. Such a document must meet all of the following criteria: It must conform to the constraints expressed in one of the three DTDs found in DTDs and in Appendix B. The root element of the document must be html. The DTD subset must not be used to override any parameter entities in the DTD. The following example shows the way in which XHTML 1.0 could be used in conjunction with the MathML Recommendation: The following example shows the way in which XHTML 1.0 markup could be incorporated into another XML namespace: A conforming user agent must meet all of the following criteria: White space is handled according to the following rules. The following characters are defined in [XML] white space characters: The XML processor normalizes different systems' line end codes into one single LINE FEED character, that is passed up to the application. This section is informative. Although overlapping is illegal in SGML, it is widely tolerated in existing browsers. CORRECT: nested elements. &lt;p&gt;here is an emphasized &lt;em&gt;paragraph&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; INCORRECT: overlapping elements &lt;p&gt;here is an emphasized &lt;em&gt;paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt; XHTML documents must use lower case for all HTML element and attribute names. This difference is necessary because XML is case-sensitive e.g. &lt;li&gt; and &lt;LI&gt; are different tags. CORRECT: terminated elements &lt;p&gt;here is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;here is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; INCORRECT: unterminated elements &lt;p&gt;here is a paragraph.&lt;p&gt;here is another paragraph.

SGML gives the writer of a DTD the ability to exclude specific elements from being contained within an element. Such prohibitions (called "exclusions") are not possible in XML. Note that in XHTML 1.0, the name attribute of these elements is formally deprecated, and will be removed in a subsequent version of XHTML. This section is normative. This appendix is normative. This appendix is normative. This appendix is informative. Avoid line breaks and multiple white space characters within attribute values. These are handled inconsistently by user agents. Don't include more than one isindex element in the document head. The isindex element is deprecated in favor of the input element. Use both the lang and xml:lang attributes when specifying the language of an element. The value of the xml:lang attribute takes precedence. This appendix is informative.

See "May". A value or behavior is unspecified, but it is not allowed to be used by Conforming Documents nor to be supported by Conforming User Agents. See "Must". Certain facilities in this specification are optional. If a facility is supported, it behaves as specified by this specification. An attribute is a parameter to an element declared in the DTD. An attribute's type and value range, including a possible default value, are defined in the DTD. See User Agent. A user agent is a system that processes XHTML documents in accordance with this specification. See User Agent Conformance for more information. must not contain other a elements. must not contain the img, object, big, small, sub, or sup elements. must not contain other label elements. must not contain other form elements. XHTML documents are XML conforming. As such, they are readily viewed, edited, and validated with standard XML tools. XHTML documents can be written to operate as well or better than they did before in existing HTML&#160;4-conforming user agents as well as in new, XHTML 1.0 conforming user agents. As the XHTML family evolves, documents conforming to XHTML 1.0 will be more likely to interoperate within and among various XHTML environments. If a user agent encounters an element it does not recognize, it must process the element's content. If a user agent encounters an attribute it does not recognize, it must ignore the entire attribute specification (i.e., the attribute and its value). If a user agent encounters an attribute value it does not recognize, it must use the default attribute value. SPACE (&amp;#x0020;) HORIZONTAL TABULATION (&amp;#x0009;) CARRIAGE RETURN (&amp;#x000D;) LINE FEED (&amp;#x000A;) Strip leading and trailing white space. Map sequences of one or more white space characters (including line breaks) to a single inter-word space. CSS style sheets for XHTML should use lower case element and attribute names. Within the XHTML namespace, user agents are expected to recognize the "class" attribute. Therefore, style sheets should be able to continue using the shorthand "." selector syntax.

A conforming printer SHALL print a static version of a form using default and selected values as specified in the form. The attribute applies to a user interface which is not represented on a printed page. For example, the accesskey attribute is irrelevant. The attribute applies to form submission which is not performed by the printer, the method attribute of the form element for example. The attribute, such as title, describes data which is not represented on a printed page The attribute applies to objects other than JPEG images, such as Java applets. The attribute does not apply since links specified by the anchor element are not followed. Embedded thumbnails Rotation Progressive rendering The User enters a URL into the Browser The Browser fetches the form from the Server and displays it The User enters data into the form The User asks the Browser to print the form The Browser composes a page with the form and the user data The Browser sends the newly composed form to the printer The User selects the Submit button on the form The Browser sends the user data to the Server The user then clicks on the browser's print button (step 4 of Sequence Diagram 1), to print the form as it currently appears. The browser sends (step 6 of Sequence Diagram 1) the document created in step 5 to the printer.

This section is non-normative. This section is non-normative. This section is non-normative.  To illustrate, suppose we have the following set of facts: Host Languages that incorporate RDFa must adhere to the following:  The general syntax of a CURIE can be summarized as follows:   In RDFa these values are defined as follows: This section is non-normative. For example, the full IRI for Albert Einstein on DBPedia is: whilst to express the IRI above as a CURIE an author would do this: The author could also use a safe CURIE, as follows: would each generate the following triple: Consider the following example:  The processing rules are: This section is non-normative. This would generate the following triples: It is possible for the data to appear elsewhere in the document: which would still generate the triple: This should generate the following triples: Similarly, authors may make statements about images: which should generate the following triple: also creates the triple: the generated triples also include: This usage of “isolated” @typeof may be viewed as a shorthand for:  Similarly,  generates:  An RDFa Processor will generate the following triples:   An RDFa Processor will generate the following triples:  and second it is used to generate its own triple:  In this example there is one incomplete triple:  First the following incomplete triple is stored:  but processing dbp:dateOfBirth generates only one:  There are two types of object, IRI resources and literals.  Both of these examples give the following triple:  Literals can be given a data type using @datatype. This can be represented in RDFa as follows: which then yields two triples: yielding: Resulting in: which results in the following output graph: After vocabulary expansion, the output graph contains: This section is non-normative. Vocabulary expansion is then performed as follows: This section is non-normative. Specifically, the following datatypes are defined: This section is non-normative. This section is non-normative. which defines a prefix for the FOAF IRI. This section is non-normative. This section is non-normative.

A slightly different handling of @typeof, making it better adapted to practical usage. The document MUST be well-formed as defined in [XML10-4e].  There is no default vocabulary IRI. Syntax attributes: @prefix, @vocab. Subject attributes: @about. Predicate attributes: @property, @rel, @rev. Resource attributes: @resource, @href, @src. Literal attributes: @datatype, @content, @xml:lang or @lang. Macro attributes: @typeof, @inlist. a set of mappings from prefixes to IRIs; a mapping to use with the default prefix (for example, :p); a mapping to use when there is no prefix (for example, p); A list mapping that associates IRIs with lists. An initially empty language value. A recurse flag. Processing generally continues recursively through the entire tree of elements available. However,      if an author indicates that some branch of the tree should be treated as an XML literal, no further processing should      take place on that branch, and setting this flag to false would have that effect.      The local list mapping, mapping IRIs to lists If the value is a valid CURIE, then the resulting IRI is used. If the value is an absolute IRI, that value is used. Otherwise, the value is ignored. @vocab supports an IRI. the parent object is set to null; the list of incomplete triples is empty; the list mapping is empty; the language is set to null. the recurse flag is set to 'true'; the skip element flag is set to 'false'; new subject is set to null; current object resource is set to null; typed resource is set to null; A rdfa:Warning MUST be generated when a Term fails to be resolved. rdf:type rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:subPropertyOf owl:equivalentClass References to the other RDFa 1.1 documents, as well as to RDF 1.1 documents, have been updated A minor clarification has been added to section 4.1. to the processors can return processor and output graphs DO NOT use the @vocab feature.

The IANA registration for application/xhtml+xml was accepted during PR, leading to a small update to the corresponding section. "Parsed URL" has been given a proper mapping to the URL specification Improved the informative summary for several elements. (Mostly pointers to tag omission and ARIA rules.) Updated a few references to documents that have seen new revisions (RFC4281, RFC2313, RFC3490, MPEG-DASH) and provided a more stable link to BECSS.

The Protocols and Formats Working Group is no longer chartered to operate. Its work will continue in two new Working Groups: Resources from the PFWG remain available to support long-term institutional memory, but this information is of historical value only. The PFWG holds face-to-face meetings in various locations as needed. Information about upcoming and past meetings is in the PFWG Meetings page. In the past, PFWG meetings were held in W3C Member space; information about those meetings is available in the PFWG Group Meetings page. WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. The work has been divided into a series of modules and related documents.  The current editor's working drafts of these are:  Formal Public Working Drafts of these documents can be found from the WAI-ARIA Overview Page.  Editors' sources for the above specifications are maintained in the W3C ARIA GitHub repository. GitHub users can watch this repository and send pull requests. Media Accessibility User Requiremenst (public editors' draft) aggregates the requirements of an accessibility user that the W3C HTML5 Accessibility Task Force has collected with respect to audio and video on the Web. See also the Public Working Draft of Media Accessibility User Requirements. Editors' sources for the above specification is maintained in the W3C PFWG GitHub repository. GitHub users can watch this repository and send pull requests.  WAI-ARIA 1.0 has been completed. The work has been divided into five documents.  The following documents are W3C Recommendations: The following documents were developed for WAI-ARIA 1.0 but have not been, and are not expected to be, finalized. Role Attribute 1.0 is a W3C Recommendation. The Role Attribute allows the author to annotate markup languages with machine-extractable semantic information about the purpose of an element. Use cases include accessibility, device adaptation, server-side processing, and complex data description. This attribute can be integrated into any markup language. The role attribute is necessary to support WAI-ARIA to define roles in XML-based languages, when the languages do not define their own role attribute.   In addition to the work underway above, the PFWG has been responsible in the past for the incorporation of a number of the accessibility improvements introduced into W3C formats from HTML 4.0 onward including CSS, SMIL, SVG and VoiceXML. Some specific publications developed in service of this work:  Work of the PFWG is in accordance with the W3C Process. PFWG work is funded in part by the WAI Core project. The work of this group does not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the funder. The charter of the working group outlines the goals, work methods, and requirements for participation. It also explains why the working drafts and email archives of this group are in the members-only area. This activity is conducted by the W3C as part of its Web Accessibility Initiative W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a patent.

This specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that set out an abstract model for accessible interfaces and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of Web Content and Applications. This information can be mapped to accessibility frameworks that use this information to provide alternative access solutions. Similarly, this information can be used to change the rendering of content dynamically using different style sheet properties. The result is an interoperable method for associating behaviors with document-level markup. See also the Public version of WAI-ARIA 1.1. Describes how user agents should map WAI-ARIA features to platform accessibility APIs. Other Accessibility API Mappings specifications depend on and extend this Core specification for specific technologies, including native techology features and WAI-ARIA extensions. See also the Public Working Draft of the Core Accessibility API Mappings. Describes how user agents determine names and descriptions of accessible objects from web content languages and expose them in accessibility APIs. See also the Public Working Draft of the Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.1.  This document describes how user agents map HTML5.1 [[!HTML51]] elements and attributes to platform accessibility API roles, states and properties on a variety of platforms, based on the Core Accessibility API Mappings [[!CORE-AAM]] specification for user agents. This document is designed to leverage these core mappings for the HTML5.1 host language.   This document describes how user agents maps SVG2 markup to platform accessibility APIs based on the Core Accessibility API Mappings [CAAM] specification for user agents.  This document describes how user agents maps digital publishing markup to platform accessibility APIs based on the Core Accessibility API Mappings [CAAM] specification for user agents. Provides recommended approaches to create accessible Web content using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible.

Provides recommended approaches to create accessible Web content using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible. Also describes considerations that might not be evident to most implementors from the WAI-ARIA specification alone.  This paper evaluates the accessibility problems with CAPTCHA, a visual verification system popular on many Web sites, and evaluates a number of more-accessible alternatives to the same problems CAPTCHA claims to solve. This paper suggests a possible implementation of a language annotation system to clarify meaning in potentially ambiguous terms. The discussions for XAG take place on the public wai-xtech list. This specification is developed by the Working Group.

The following two productions are modified versions of ones which were present in the first two editions of this specification. They are no longer used, but are retained here to satisfy cross-references to undated versions of this specification. Because the Letter production of XML 1.0, originally used in the definition of NCNameStartChar, is no longer the correct basis for defining names since XML 1.0 Fifth Edition, the NCNameStartChar production has been modified to give the correct results against any edition of XML, by defining NCNameStartChar in terms of NCName.

Very openly licensed standards. Open spec history and editing. specs with open revision history specs with edit buttons IndieWebCamp Events! Comments Off This post was originally posted on tantek.com. Classic microformats have been serving the web community’s need to extend HTML’s expressive power since 2004. Through an evolutionary, open, rigorous community process and human-first design principles, structured use of the class and rel attributes have paved the cowpaths of publishing data about people, places, events, reviews, products and more. Microformats2 is the next big effort by the community to improve how microformats are authored, parsed and defined. Version two has multiple working open source implementations which independents are using in production and is easier to publish and consume than ever. In this series of guides I’ll show you how to be the next site publishing and consuming microformats. In order to demonstrate some of the differences between microformats 2 and Classic Microformats/other competing technologies, I’ll use the process of content-out markup — going from plain text to HTML and finally adding a sprinkling of microformats. Let’s start with my favourite example: mentioning a person. As plain text: With HTML: With classic microformats: That’s 37 extra characters and a whole extra nested element just to say “This link is to a person”, not to mention the strangely named root classname (vcard? I thought this was an hcard?) and multiple cryptic fn n classnames. Competing technologies are typically even longer and messier. With microformats 2 this all becomes much simpler: Weighing in at only 15 characters, this is quicker to type, easier on the eyes and easier to remember. There are two fundamental changes in microformats 2 which make this helium-esque lightness possible: Implied Properties and prefixed classnames. When you give class=h-card to an element, you’re saying “This element represents a person”. In many cases the element will be simple; just a name, perhaps with a link or photo. Why should you add extra elements and classnames just to tell a dumb computer which bit is the name, URL or photo URL when that information is already expressed by the markup? Implied properties save you from this tedium. When you specify an element as an h-card without explicitly defining which parts are the name, url or photo url, the parser will figure out what you meant. And it’s not just for h-cards either — thanks to the new generic parsing in microformats 2, this shorthand works for any microformat. Classic microformats used plain classnames which looked like any other (e.g. vcard, n or note). There were a few problems with this — classnames would clash, cause false positives or be thrown away by developers who weren’t microformats-aware (“these classnames aren’t doing anything!”). This also meant parsers were tricky to write, as each one had to maintain a long list of classnames used by each microformats, resulting in many parsers quickly going out of date. Prefixing classnames solves both of these problems: semantic microformats2 classnames are set apart from styling hooks, and parsers can figure out which classnames to look for, cutting down on maintenance. There are 5 prefixes: I’ll demonstrate the use of all of these prefixes with some real-world examples. Firstly, another h-card, more fleshed out than the earlier example. This might be the sort that you put on your homepage: p-name, u-url and u-photo are fairly standard properties you’ll see over and over again. Another improvement in microformats 2 is increasing consistency between different microformat specifications — again, making them easier to authors to remember and consumers to understand. A nice side effect is that a single element can be more than one type of microformat at once — for example a h-entry and h-review. To demonstrate dt-* and e-*, here’s a note (like a tweet or short blog post), marked up using h-entry: Here, I want the HTML inside the content to be passed to the parser, so I mark it up as e-*. Notice I’m also specifying that content as the summary and name — one element can be parsed as multiple properties. I’m using the time element to mark up the time this note was published. Because I’ve prefixed the classname with dt- and it’s on a time element, parsers know to look in the datetime attribute if it exists. The third area in which microformats2 improves on the previous version is in combining microformats and making each microformat specification more reusable — for example, both a person or an event might have an address, so it makes sense to reuse the same markup for both. There are many reasons to combine microformats — say you want to specify the author of a blog post or review. You would do so by making the p-author of the post an h-card: Or a comment on an article, via h-cites as p-comments: The reason comments are h-cites instead of h-entrys is that h-entry implies syndication — it’s something you’ve posted, or have re-posted, whereas a comment is a reference to a post on another site. Or the address of a person or event, using h-adr: Hopefully this overview tickled your interest and gave you a firm foundation from which to base further investigation. To learn more about the topics covered in this post, see the following URLs: This article reposted from Getting Started With microformats2 on waterpigs.co.uk, and is the first of a series covering microformats2. Be sure to follow my articles feed to be notified about the others. I also post notes about microformats quite often. They&#8217;re syndicated to my twitter account too. Humans first (machines second). microformats are designed primarily for humans, and primarily for the greatest number of humans, whether authoring, or representing (e.g. the microformats community spearheaded and got the most inclusive &#8220;gender&#8221; property ever designed into the vCard 4 (RFC 6350) &#8211; which hCard 1.1 and 2 uses). Today, Google launched a new search feature: Recipe View! The new search category enables users to discover recipes that have been marked-up following the hRecipe specification from a variety of sources with a new level of accuracy.  Google have made it easy for users to find recipes, because authors are now making it easy for them to locate their data from within their web pages.  Wired reports: “Our intent is to make better user expereince to see if we can jumpstart this ecosystem,” Menzel said. “That way when someone thinks ‘Hey, I just invented a great recipe, let me put it on my blog,’ and that person’s recipe should be a candidate.” But Menzel insists it’s got to be easy and that Google doesn’t want to push busy webmasters to do any work that won’t result in more traffic. “This is really a pragmatic response to the dream of the semantic web,” Menzel said. “We would love if the XML world existed — it would make search awesome, but no one is going to to do it. But we need to start somewhere, and a lot of the internet is built manually by people and their time is valuable.” ReadWriteWeb also notes: Google didn&#8217;t indicate if it has plans to expand this sort of markup into other search efforts, but it&#8217;s a good reason &#8211; at the very least for recipe publishers &#8211; to mark up your websites. We&#8217;re very excited about this new feature from Google, and are pleased to see the organisation continue to support and implement open standards that are simple for authors everywhere to use. For more information on the specification, check out the hRecipe wiki pages. As of today, Facebook has marked up all events with the hCalendar microformat including marking up their venues with hCard as well. According to a simple Google search, that&#8217;s millions of public events now with microformats (if anyone knows a more precise number for the total number of Facebook events including private ones, or how many events are created per day, please let us know!). Here&#8217;s an upcoming example: the Great British Booze-up at SXSW 2011 (which I highly recommend if you&#8217;re into high fidelity markup, as a bunch of us will be there sharing drinks and post-future-panel microformats conversations). Visit it in a browser that supports microformats (there are now plugins for Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari). E.g. try Firefox 4 with the Operator Add-On, and you&#8217;ll see &#8220;Events (1)&#8221; in the toolbar. Just one click reveals &#8220;Great British Booze-up&#8221; which you can then choose to export to your iCal, 30 Boxes, Google, or Yahoo calendars. And if you&#8217;re a user, that&#8217;s it. The ability to copy events to where you want them. If you publish hCalendar, Google will index and show rich snippets for your events. That&#8217;s what microformats empower you to do. For the web authors/designers/developers out there, let&#8217;s take a closer look at Facebook&#8217;s markup. If you view source on the page and search for &#8220;vevent&#8221;, you see the following code: Which indicates that this page is an event. Searching further in the source you&#8217;ll find that Facebook generates the rest of the from a script. While this isn&#8217;t ideal (in general it&#8217;s better to have the markup in markup), apparently there are sometimes performance reasons for script generated content. No matter, we can use Firefox&#8217;s &#8220;View Selection Source&#8221; context menu to view the generated markup. I want to call out two specific aspects of Facebook&#8217;s implementation.  Select the entire date time row: &#8220;Time   Monday, March 14 · 6:00pm &#8211; 9:00pm&#8221; and right/control-click on it and choose &#8220;View Selection Source&#8221;. Here&#8217;s most of the markup you&#8217;ll see (white-space added for readability). Minor update 2011-02-18: The &#8220;-07:00&#8243; timezone offsets were removed as they were not reliably accurate. Better to omit the timezone offset, use floating datetimes and let the consumer infer timezone from location as needed. Encoding dates and times that work for humans and machines has been one of the biggest challenges in microformats, and what you&#8217;re seeing here is the result of years of community iteration (techniques, feedback, research) called the &#8216;value-title&#8217; technique of the value class pattern. In short, by placing the machine readable ISO datetime into the title attribute of a harmless empty span element adjacent to the human readable date and time, we are able to achieve a pragmatic balance between user experience, content fidelity, and minimizing the effects of what is essentially duplicating the data (a DRY violation, something we avoid due to potential inconsistencies unless absolutely necessary for a greater principle, such as usability &#8211; humans first as it were). This is the largest deployment of the &#8216;value-title&#8217; technique known to date, and works great with the value class pattern support in Operator. Let&#8217;s take a look at the venue. View Selection Source on the entire block from &#8220;Location   Shakespeare&#8217;s Pub&#8221; to &#8220;78701&#8243; and you&#8217;ll see (again with whitespace added) This is an excellent example of using a nested hCard for an hCalendar event venue, except for one thing: Which should be marked up more like: I&#8217;m guessing what&#8217;s going on here is too coarse of an interface between a backend and frontend system, that is, for convenience the developers may be retrieving the entirety of the city, state, and zip from their backend as a single string, and thus the best the front end can do is to mark up the entire thing as the city (locality).   While not ideal, this isn&#8217;t horrible either. Using Operator again, choose &#8220;Export Contact&#8221; for Shakespeare&#8217;s Pub, and note that your address book displays it just fine (even if the fields aren&#8217;t exactly in the right spots). Copy and pasting that address to a map site also works. The markup isn&#8217;t ideal, but it&#8217;s usable and useful, and I for one am happy that Facebook chose to go ahead and make that pragmatic decision and ship now, while knowing they could iterate and improve data fidelity in a subsequent update. Facebook&#8217;s deployment of hCalendar is just the latest in their series of slow but steadily increasing support for open standards and microformats in particular. Over two years ago Facebook added hCard support to their user profiles. Last year they announced support for OAuth 2.0, as well as adding XFN rel-me support to user profiles, thus interconnecting with the world wide distributed social web. They proudly documented their use of HTML5. And now, millions of hCalendar events with hCard venues. Looking forward to seeing what they support next. Well done Facebook, and keep up the good work. Designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards.

GRDDL does this by shifting the burden of formulating RDF away from the author to transformation algorithms written specifically for XML dialects such as XHTML. In this document the term HTML is used to refer to the XHTML dialect of HTML [XHTML]. While anyone can create a transformation, a standard transform library has been provided that can extract RDF that's embedded directly in XML or HTML using &lt;rdf:RDF&gt; tags as well as extract any profile transformations. GRDDL transformations can be made for almost any dialect, including microformats. One persistent and troublesome problem is discovering precisely when and where your friends are  together so that you can schedule a meeting. In our example, a frequent traveller called Jane is trying see if at any point next year she can schedule a meeting with all three of her friends, despite the fact that all of her friends publish their calendar data in different ways. With GRDDL, she can discover if they can meet up without forcing her friends to all use the same centralized Web-based calendar system.  The resulting HTML looks like this Microformat-enabled web-pages on the Web may not be  valid XHTML. For this purpose, one may wish to use a program like Tidy (or some other algorithm) to make the web-page equivalent to valid XHTML before applying GRDDL [GRDDL-SCENARIOS].  Also, many microformats may not have profiles with transformations. A user can always take matters into their own hands  by applying a GRDDL transformation for a microformat directly to the web page in order to get RDF. This is risky since if the author of the document or microformat vocabulary does not explicitly license a GRDDL transformation, the responsibility for those RDF is now in the hands of the user.  Jane would like to meet with David and Robin, but does not want to manually check all their calendars, a process that is tiresome and prone to human error. To solve this problem, Jane decides to use a GRDDL implementation that converts both Robin and David's calendar to RDF.  Jane stores her calendar directly in RDFa, a way of embedding RDF directly into HTML. She can use a GRDDL Transformation for RDFa to convert RDFa to RDF/XML, in order to get her entire schedule in RDF/XML. The relevant results of querying the results of GRDDL is: So Jane discovers her friends Robin and David are both in town with her in Edinburgh on January 8th through 10th for the Web Design Conference. Since this is such as useful SPARQL script, she considers bundling it up as a web service so her friends can use it easily without writing SPARQL from scratch. Jane is pleased that she has found out all her friends can finally meet up in Edinburgh. However, she is not sure of where to stay in Edinburgh, so she decides to check reviews. There are various special interest publications online which feature hotel reviews, and blogs which contain reviews by individuals. The reviewers include friends and colleagues of Jane and people whose opinion Jane values (e.g. friends  and people whose reviews Jane has found useful in the past). There may also be reviews planted by hotel advertisers which offer biased views in an attempt to attract customers. This XFN file can be converted to RDF with the use of another GRDDL Transform for XFN, resulting in the  example RDF result file. Hotel review sites include a number of reviews, including some in Edinburgh. This particular hotel review file is also marked up with the hReview that we can also convert to RDF using a transform, resulting in a RDF version of the hotel reviews. A portion of the hotel file example in HTML is given below to illustrate the use of the hReview microformat:  In order to find hotels with specific ratings or higher from a group of her trusted friends, we can now query the &quot;mashed-up&quot; data with SPARQL. SPARQL (The SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a query language for RDF that can automatically &quot;mash-up&quot; data from multiple sources. This query results in: The query unfortunately gets us all hotels from anywhere in the world with more than 2 stars, so we need to further restrict the results to only hotels in Edinburgh, as we do in this improved query. This results in: We finally get the result we want: A hotel with a ranking of 5 reviewed by a trusted friend. Which would give the following results: GRDDL can not only be used for combining HTML data, but for XML data as well. This section uses HL7 CDA, a widely deployed XML vocabulary for use in clinical data, as an example of how an XML dialect can be gleaned for RDF. This part of the primer walks through step-by-step the Health Care: Querying XML-based clinical data use-case. Kayode wants  to write software components which can extract RDF descriptions from XML HL7  CDA documents transmitted from various devices in a healthcare system using a clinical ontology so that he can merge together clinical reports and use inferences to detect possible problems.  CDA is a very well-designed information model and heavily optimized for messaging between computerized hospital systems, and an example CDA document is given. Below is a section of this document that describes the author of a clinical document and the patient that the document describes. This GRDDL-enhanced CDA document  can be processed by an XSLT pipeline resulting in a corresponding RDF graph  which expresses clinical content in expressive, heavily deployed consensus vocabularies such as Open GALEN, DOLCE: Descriptive Ontology of Linguistics and Cognitive Engineering, FOAF, and an OWL translation of HL7 RIM [OWL].  An example OWL ontology describes the basic concepts in a medical record for the purposes of this example.  In a manner similar to enabling the use of GRDDL with HTML, we can add a glean:transformation attribute to the root of the document in order for a GRDDL-aware agent to interpret an HL7 CDA message transmitted using widely-used and interoperable ontologies. Once the data is expressed in RDF, one can discover several useful facts about the patient's diagnosis that would be unclear in the original XML document. Most important is that the patient's chest X-ray (a cyc:XRayImage or foaf:Image) concludes a medical problem (cpr:medical-sign).  A SNOMED CT code is used which corresponds to a specific term in the description-logic inspired language which SNOMED CT is expressed in. Here's a snippet from the result of running the GRDDL transformation, expressed in the brief Turtle syntax for RDF. If we run this SPARQL query over our data-set that has been enlarged by the use of OWL reasoning, then we can detect that a chest has been hyperinflated. Knowing that the original CDA contains the an image with medical significance would be of importance to the patient.   In this manner GRDDL allows one to bootstrap Semantic Web data from common XML dialects, and so help these XML dialects  interoperate by reference to well-known ontologies and allow their content to be extended by the use of inference.

There are no types of objects that can be converted to node-sets. The + operator performs addition. The - operator performs subtraction. When tokenizing, the longest possible token is always returned. Otherwise, the token must not be recognized as a MultiplyOperator, an OperatorName, a NodeType, a FunctionName, or an AxisName. A number is converted to a string as follows a node-set is true if and only if it is non-empty a string is true if and only if its length is non-zero The true function returns true. The false function returns false. The tree contains nodes.  There are seven types of node: root nodes element nodes text nodes attribute nodes namespace nodes processing instruction nodes comment nodes The root node does not have an expanded-name. A comment node does not have an expanded-name. A text node does not have an expanded-name.

Very openly licensed standards. Open spec history and editing. specs with open revision history specs with edit buttons IndieWebCamp Events! Comments Off This post was originally posted on tantek.com. Classic microformats have been serving the web community’s need to extend HTML’s expressive power since 2004. Through an evolutionary, open, rigorous community process and human-first design principles, structured use of the class and rel attributes have paved the cowpaths of publishing data about people, places, events, reviews, products and more. Microformats2 is the next big effort by the community to improve how microformats are authored, parsed and defined. Version two has multiple working open source implementations which independents are using in production and is easier to publish and consume than ever. In this series of guides I’ll show you how to be the next site publishing and consuming microformats. In order to demonstrate some of the differences between microformats 2 and Classic Microformats/other competing technologies, I’ll use the process of content-out markup — going from plain text to HTML and finally adding a sprinkling of microformats. Let’s start with my favourite example: mentioning a person. As plain text: With HTML: With classic microformats: That’s 37 extra characters and a whole extra nested element just to say “This link is to a person”, not to mention the strangely named root classname (vcard? I thought this was an hcard?) and multiple cryptic fn n classnames. Competing technologies are typically even longer and messier. With microformats 2 this all becomes much simpler: Weighing in at only 15 characters, this is quicker to type, easier on the eyes and easier to remember. There are two fundamental changes in microformats 2 which make this helium-esque lightness possible: Implied Properties and prefixed classnames. When you give class=h-card to an element, you’re saying “This element represents a person”. In many cases the element will be simple; just a name, perhaps with a link or photo. Why should you add extra elements and classnames just to tell a dumb computer which bit is the name, URL or photo URL when that information is already expressed by the markup? Implied properties save you from this tedium. When you specify an element as an h-card without explicitly defining which parts are the name, url or photo url, the parser will figure out what you meant. And it’s not just for h-cards either — thanks to the new generic parsing in microformats 2, this shorthand works for any microformat. Classic microformats used plain classnames which looked like any other (e.g. vcard, n or note). There were a few problems with this — classnames would clash, cause false positives or be thrown away by developers who weren’t microformats-aware (“these classnames aren’t doing anything!”). This also meant parsers were tricky to write, as each one had to maintain a long list of classnames used by each microformats, resulting in many parsers quickly going out of date. Prefixing classnames solves both of these problems: semantic microformats2 classnames are set apart from styling hooks, and parsers can figure out which classnames to look for, cutting down on maintenance. There are 5 prefixes: I’ll demonstrate the use of all of these prefixes with some real-world examples. Firstly, another h-card, more fleshed out than the earlier example. This might be the sort that you put on your homepage: p-name, u-url and u-photo are fairly standard properties you’ll see over and over again. Another improvement in microformats 2 is increasing consistency between different microformat specifications — again, making them easier to authors to remember and consumers to understand. A nice side effect is that a single element can be more than one type of microformat at once — for example a h-entry and h-review. To demonstrate dt-* and e-*, here’s a note (like a tweet or short blog post), marked up using h-entry: Here, I want the HTML inside the content to be passed to the parser, so I mark it up as e-*. Notice I’m also specifying that content as the summary and name — one element can be parsed as multiple properties. I’m using the time element to mark up the time this note was published. Because I’ve prefixed the classname with dt- and it’s on a time element, parsers know to look in the datetime attribute if it exists. The third area in which microformats2 improves on the previous version is in combining microformats and making each microformat specification more reusable — for example, both a person or an event might have an address, so it makes sense to reuse the same markup for both. There are many reasons to combine microformats — say you want to specify the author of a blog post or review. You would do so by making the p-author of the post an h-card: Or a comment on an article, via h-cites as p-comments: The reason comments are h-cites instead of h-entrys is that h-entry implies syndication — it’s something you’ve posted, or have re-posted, whereas a comment is a reference to a post on another site. Or the address of a person or event, using h-adr: Hopefully this overview tickled your interest and gave you a firm foundation from which to base further investigation. To learn more about the topics covered in this post, see the following URLs: This article reposted from Getting Started With microformats2 on waterpigs.co.uk, and is the first of a series covering microformats2. Be sure to follow my articles feed to be notified about the others. I also post notes about microformats quite often. They&#8217;re syndicated to my twitter account too. Humans first (machines second). microformats are designed primarily for humans, and primarily for the greatest number of humans, whether authoring, or representing (e.g. the microformats community spearheaded and got the most inclusive &#8220;gender&#8221; property ever designed into the vCard 4 (RFC 6350) &#8211; which hCard 1.1 and 2 uses). Today, Google launched a new search feature: Recipe View! The new search category enables users to discover recipes that have been marked-up following the hRecipe specification from a variety of sources with a new level of accuracy.  Google have made it easy for users to find recipes, because authors are now making it easy for them to locate their data from within their web pages.  Wired reports: “Our intent is to make better user expereince to see if we can jumpstart this ecosystem,” Menzel said. “That way when someone thinks ‘Hey, I just invented a great recipe, let me put it on my blog,’ and that person’s recipe should be a candidate.” But Menzel insists it’s got to be easy and that Google doesn’t want to push busy webmasters to do any work that won’t result in more traffic. “This is really a pragmatic response to the dream of the semantic web,” Menzel said. “We would love if the XML world existed — it would make search awesome, but no one is going to to do it. But we need to start somewhere, and a lot of the internet is built manually by people and their time is valuable.” ReadWriteWeb also notes: Google didn&#8217;t indicate if it has plans to expand this sort of markup into other search efforts, but it&#8217;s a good reason &#8211; at the very least for recipe publishers &#8211; to mark up your websites. We&#8217;re very excited about this new feature from Google, and are pleased to see the organisation continue to support and implement open standards that are simple for authors everywhere to use. For more information on the specification, check out the hRecipe wiki pages. As of today, Facebook has marked up all events with the hCalendar microformat including marking up their venues with hCard as well. According to a simple Google search, that&#8217;s millions of public events now with microformats (if anyone knows a more precise number for the total number of Facebook events including private ones, or how many events are created per day, please let us know!). Here&#8217;s an upcoming example: the Great British Booze-up at SXSW 2011 (which I highly recommend if you&#8217;re into high fidelity markup, as a bunch of us will be there sharing drinks and post-future-panel microformats conversations). Visit it in a browser that supports microformats (there are now plugins for Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari). E.g. try Firefox 4 with the Operator Add-On, and you&#8217;ll see &#8220;Events (1)&#8221; in the toolbar. Just one click reveals &#8220;Great British Booze-up&#8221; which you can then choose to export to your iCal, 30 Boxes, Google, or Yahoo calendars. And if you&#8217;re a user, that&#8217;s it. The ability to copy events to where you want them. If you publish hCalendar, Google will index and show rich snippets for your events. That&#8217;s what microformats empower you to do. For the web authors/designers/developers out there, let&#8217;s take a closer look at Facebook&#8217;s markup. If you view source on the page and search for &#8220;vevent&#8221;, you see the following code: Which indicates that this page is an event. Searching further in the source you&#8217;ll find that Facebook generates the rest of the from a script. While this isn&#8217;t ideal (in general it&#8217;s better to have the markup in markup), apparently there are sometimes performance reasons for script generated content. No matter, we can use Firefox&#8217;s &#8220;View Selection Source&#8221; context menu to view the generated markup. I want to call out two specific aspects of Facebook&#8217;s implementation.  Select the entire date time row: &#8220;Time   Monday, March 14 · 6:00pm &#8211; 9:00pm&#8221; and right/control-click on it and choose &#8220;View Selection Source&#8221;. Here&#8217;s most of the markup you&#8217;ll see (white-space added for readability). Minor update 2011-02-18: The &#8220;-07:00&#8243; timezone offsets were removed as they were not reliably accurate. Better to omit the timezone offset, use floating datetimes and let the consumer infer timezone from location as needed. Encoding dates and times that work for humans and machines has been one of the biggest challenges in microformats, and what you&#8217;re seeing here is the result of years of community iteration (techniques, feedback, research) called the &#8216;value-title&#8217; technique of the value class pattern. In short, by placing the machine readable ISO datetime into the title attribute of a harmless empty span element adjacent to the human readable date and time, we are able to achieve a pragmatic balance between user experience, content fidelity, and minimizing the effects of what is essentially duplicating the data (a DRY violation, something we avoid due to potential inconsistencies unless absolutely necessary for a greater principle, such as usability &#8211; humans first as it were). This is the largest deployment of the &#8216;value-title&#8217; technique known to date, and works great with the value class pattern support in Operator. Let&#8217;s take a look at the venue. View Selection Source on the entire block from &#8220;Location   Shakespeare&#8217;s Pub&#8221; to &#8220;78701&#8243; and you&#8217;ll see (again with whitespace added) This is an excellent example of using a nested hCard for an hCalendar event venue, except for one thing: Which should be marked up more like: I&#8217;m guessing what&#8217;s going on here is too coarse of an interface between a backend and frontend system, that is, for convenience the developers may be retrieving the entirety of the city, state, and zip from their backend as a single string, and thus the best the front end can do is to mark up the entire thing as the city (locality).   While not ideal, this isn&#8217;t horrible either. Using Operator again, choose &#8220;Export Contact&#8221; for Shakespeare&#8217;s Pub, and note that your address book displays it just fine (even if the fields aren&#8217;t exactly in the right spots). Copy and pasting that address to a map site also works. The markup isn&#8217;t ideal, but it&#8217;s usable and useful, and I for one am happy that Facebook chose to go ahead and make that pragmatic decision and ship now, while knowing they could iterate and improve data fidelity in a subsequent update. Facebook&#8217;s deployment of hCalendar is just the latest in their series of slow but steadily increasing support for open standards and microformats in particular. Over two years ago Facebook added hCard support to their user profiles. Last year they announced support for OAuth 2.0, as well as adding XFN rel-me support to user profiles, thus interconnecting with the world wide distributed social web. They proudly documented their use of HTML5. And now, millions of hCalendar events with hCard venues. Looking forward to seeing what they support next. Well done Facebook, and keep up the good work. Designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards.

GRDDL does this by shifting the burden of formulating RDF away from the author to transformation algorithms written specifically for XML dialects such as XHTML. In this document the term HTML is used to refer to the XHTML dialect of HTML [XHTML]. While anyone can create a transformation, a standard transform library has been provided that can extract RDF that's embedded directly in XML or HTML using &lt;rdf:RDF&gt; tags as well as extract any profile transformations. GRDDL transformations can be made for almost any dialect, including microformats. One persistent and troublesome problem is discovering precisely when and where your friends are  together so that you can schedule a meeting. In our example, a frequent traveller called Jane is trying see if at any point next year she can schedule a meeting with all three of her friends, despite the fact that all of her friends publish their calendar data in different ways. With GRDDL, she can discover if they can meet up without forcing her friends to all use the same centralized Web-based calendar system.  The resulting HTML looks like this Microformat-enabled web-pages on the Web may not be  valid XHTML. For this purpose, one may wish to use a program like Tidy (or some other algorithm) to make the web-page equivalent to valid XHTML before applying GRDDL [GRDDL-SCENARIOS].  Also, many microformats may not have profiles with transformations. A user can always take matters into their own hands  by applying a GRDDL transformation for a microformat directly to the web page in order to get RDF. This is risky since if the author of the document or microformat vocabulary does not explicitly license a GRDDL transformation, the responsibility for those RDF is now in the hands of the user.  Jane would like to meet with David and Robin, but does not want to manually check all their calendars, a process that is tiresome and prone to human error. To solve this problem, Jane decides to use a GRDDL implementation that converts both Robin and David's calendar to RDF.  Jane stores her calendar directly in RDFa, a way of embedding RDF directly into HTML. She can use a GRDDL Transformation for RDFa to convert RDFa to RDF/XML, in order to get her entire schedule in RDF/XML. The relevant results of querying the results of GRDDL is: So Jane discovers her friends Robin and David are both in town with her in Edinburgh on January 8th through 10th for the Web Design Conference. Since this is such as useful SPARQL script, she considers bundling it up as a web service so her friends can use it easily without writing SPARQL from scratch. Jane is pleased that she has found out all her friends can finally meet up in Edinburgh. However, she is not sure of where to stay in Edinburgh, so she decides to check reviews. There are various special interest publications online which feature hotel reviews, and blogs which contain reviews by individuals. The reviewers include friends and colleagues of Jane and people whose opinion Jane values (e.g. friends  and people whose reviews Jane has found useful in the past). There may also be reviews planted by hotel advertisers which offer biased views in an attempt to attract customers. This XFN file can be converted to RDF with the use of another GRDDL Transform for XFN, resulting in the  example RDF result file. Hotel review sites include a number of reviews, including some in Edinburgh. This particular hotel review file is also marked up with the hReview that we can also convert to RDF using a transform, resulting in a RDF version of the hotel reviews. A portion of the hotel file example in HTML is given below to illustrate the use of the hReview microformat:  In order to find hotels with specific ratings or higher from a group of her trusted friends, we can now query the &quot;mashed-up&quot; data with SPARQL. SPARQL (The SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a query language for RDF that can automatically &quot;mash-up&quot; data from multiple sources. This query results in: The query unfortunately gets us all hotels from anywhere in the world with more than 2 stars, so we need to further restrict the results to only hotels in Edinburgh, as we do in this improved query. This results in: We finally get the result we want: A hotel with a ranking of 5 reviewed by a trusted friend. Which would give the following results: GRDDL can not only be used for combining HTML data, but for XML data as well. This section uses HL7 CDA, a widely deployed XML vocabulary for use in clinical data, as an example of how an XML dialect can be gleaned for RDF. This part of the primer walks through step-by-step the Health Care: Querying XML-based clinical data use-case. Kayode wants  to write software components which can extract RDF descriptions from XML HL7  CDA documents transmitted from various devices in a healthcare system using a clinical ontology so that he can merge together clinical reports and use inferences to detect possible problems.  CDA is a very well-designed information model and heavily optimized for messaging between computerized hospital systems, and an example CDA document is given. Below is a section of this document that describes the author of a clinical document and the patient that the document describes. This GRDDL-enhanced CDA document  can be processed by an XSLT pipeline resulting in a corresponding RDF graph  which expresses clinical content in expressive, heavily deployed consensus vocabularies such as Open GALEN, DOLCE: Descriptive Ontology of Linguistics and Cognitive Engineering, FOAF, and an OWL translation of HL7 RIM [OWL].  An example OWL ontology describes the basic concepts in a medical record for the purposes of this example.  In a manner similar to enabling the use of GRDDL with HTML, we can add a glean:transformation attribute to the root of the document in order for a GRDDL-aware agent to interpret an HL7 CDA message transmitted using widely-used and interoperable ontologies. Once the data is expressed in RDF, one can discover several useful facts about the patient's diagnosis that would be unclear in the original XML document. Most important is that the patient's chest X-ray (a cyc:XRayImage or foaf:Image) concludes a medical problem (cpr:medical-sign).  A SNOMED CT code is used which corresponds to a specific term in the description-logic inspired language which SNOMED CT is expressed in. Here's a snippet from the result of running the GRDDL transformation, expressed in the brief Turtle syntax for RDF. If we run this SPARQL query over our data-set that has been enlarged by the use of OWL reasoning, then we can detect that a chest has been hyperinflated. Knowing that the original CDA contains the an image with medical significance would be of importance to the patient.   In this manner GRDDL allows one to bootstrap Semantic Web data from common XML dialects, and so help these XML dialects  interoperate by reference to well-known ontologies and allow their content to be extended by the use of inference.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats. You may read more in the press release.    W3C plans to update its site privacy policy shortly after 14 April. No material changes are intended in the new privacy policy.

XML&#8482; is the shorthand name for Extensible Markup Language [XML]. While retaining these beneficial features, XML removes many of the more complex features of SGML that make the authoring and design of suitable software both difficult and costly. The benefits of migrating to XHTML 1.0 are described above. Some of the benefits of migrating to XHTML in general are: This section is normative. This section is normative. A Strictly Conforming XHTML Document is an XML document that requires only the facilities described as mandatory in this specification. Such a document must meet all of the following criteria: It must conform to the constraints expressed in one of the three DTDs found in DTDs and in Appendix B. The root element of the document must be html. The DTD subset must not be used to override any parameter entities in the DTD. The following example shows the way in which XHTML 1.0 could be used in conjunction with the MathML Recommendation: The following example shows the way in which XHTML 1.0 markup could be incorporated into another XML namespace: A conforming user agent must meet all of the following criteria: White space is handled according to the following rules. The following characters are defined in [XML] white space characters: The XML processor normalizes different systems' line end codes into one single LINE FEED character, that is passed up to the application. This section is informative. Although overlapping is illegal in SGML, it is widely tolerated in existing browsers. CORRECT: nested elements. &lt;p&gt;here is an emphasized &lt;em&gt;paragraph&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; INCORRECT: overlapping elements &lt;p&gt;here is an emphasized &lt;em&gt;paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt; XHTML documents must use lower case for all HTML element and attribute names. This difference is necessary because XML is case-sensitive e.g. &lt;li&gt; and &lt;LI&gt; are different tags. CORRECT: terminated elements &lt;p&gt;here is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;here is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; INCORRECT: unterminated elements &lt;p&gt;here is a paragraph.&lt;p&gt;here is another paragraph.

SGML gives the writer of a DTD the ability to exclude specific elements from being contained within an element. Such prohibitions (called "exclusions") are not possible in XML. Note that in XHTML 1.0, the name attribute of these elements is formally deprecated, and will be removed in a subsequent version of XHTML. This section is normative. This appendix is normative. This appendix is normative. This appendix is informative. Avoid line breaks and multiple white space characters within attribute values. These are handled inconsistently by user agents. Don't include more than one isindex element in the document head. The isindex element is deprecated in favor of the input element. Use both the lang and xml:lang attributes when specifying the language of an element. The value of the xml:lang attribute takes precedence. This appendix is informative.

See "May". A value or behavior is unspecified, but it is not allowed to be used by Conforming Documents nor to be supported by Conforming User Agents. See "Must". Certain facilities in this specification are optional. If a facility is supported, it behaves as specified by this specification. An attribute is a parameter to an element declared in the DTD. An attribute's type and value range, including a possible default value, are defined in the DTD. See User Agent. A user agent is a system that processes XHTML documents in accordance with this specification. See User Agent Conformance for more information. must not contain other a elements. must not contain the img, object, big, small, sub, or sup elements. must not contain other label elements. must not contain other form elements. XHTML documents are XML conforming. As such, they are readily viewed, edited, and validated with standard XML tools. XHTML documents can be written to operate as well or better than they did before in existing HTML&#160;4-conforming user agents as well as in new, XHTML 1.0 conforming user agents. As the XHTML family evolves, documents conforming to XHTML 1.0 will be more likely to interoperate within and among various XHTML environments. If a user agent encounters an element it does not recognize, it must process the element's content. If a user agent encounters an attribute it does not recognize, it must ignore the entire attribute specification (i.e., the attribute and its value). If a user agent encounters an attribute value it does not recognize, it must use the default attribute value. SPACE (&amp;#x0020;) HORIZONTAL TABULATION (&amp;#x0009;) CARRIAGE RETURN (&amp;#x000D;) LINE FEED (&amp;#x000A;) Strip leading and trailing white space. Map sequences of one or more white space characters (including line breaks) to a single inter-word space. CSS style sheets for XHTML should use lower case element and attribute names. Within the XHTML namespace, user agents are expected to recognize the "class" attribute. Therefore, style sheets should be able to continue using the shorthand "." selector syntax.

XHTML-Print consists of the following XHTML modules: Each attribute in the following sections is annotated with one of the following keywords indicating support options for a conforming printer: Note that the title attribute of the Core collection is not applicable to the printed page since there is no place to display such supplementary information. A printer MAY ignore the content of the title element since it is not part of the document's body.

This section is non-normative. This section is non-normative. This section is non-normative.  To illustrate, suppose we have the following set of facts: Host Languages that incorporate RDFa must adhere to the following:  The general syntax of a CURIE can be summarized as follows:   In RDFa these values are defined as follows: This section is non-normative. For example, the full IRI for Albert Einstein on DBPedia is: whilst to express the IRI above as a CURIE an author would do this: The author could also use a safe CURIE, as follows: would each generate the following triple: Consider the following example:  The processing rules are: This section is non-normative. This would generate the following triples: It is possible for the data to appear elsewhere in the document: which would still generate the triple: This should generate the following triples: Similarly, authors may make statements about images: which should generate the following triple: also creates the triple: the generated triples also include: This usage of “isolated” @typeof may be viewed as a shorthand for:  Similarly,  generates:  An RDFa Processor will generate the following triples:   An RDFa Processor will generate the following triples:  and second it is used to generate its own triple:  In this example there is one incomplete triple:  First the following incomplete triple is stored:  but processing dbp:dateOfBirth generates only one:  There are two types of object, IRI resources and literals.  Both of these examples give the following triple:  Literals can be given a data type using @datatype. This can be represented in RDFa as follows: which then yields two triples: yielding: Resulting in: which results in the following output graph: After vocabulary expansion, the output graph contains: This section is non-normative. Vocabulary expansion is then performed as follows: This section is non-normative. Specifically, the following datatypes are defined: This section is non-normative. This section is non-normative. which defines a prefix for the FOAF IRI. This section is non-normative. This section is non-normative.

A slightly different handling of @typeof, making it better adapted to practical usage. The document MUST be well-formed as defined in [XML10-4e].  There is no default vocabulary IRI. Syntax attributes: @prefix, @vocab. Subject attributes: @about. Predicate attributes: @property, @rel, @rev. Resource attributes: @resource, @href, @src. Literal attributes: @datatype, @content, @xml:lang or @lang. Macro attributes: @typeof, @inlist. a set of mappings from prefixes to IRIs; a mapping to use with the default prefix (for example, :p); a mapping to use when there is no prefix (for example, p); A list mapping that associates IRIs with lists. An initially empty language value. A recurse flag. Processing generally continues recursively through the entire tree of elements available. However,      if an author indicates that some branch of the tree should be treated as an XML literal, no further processing should      take place on that branch, and setting this flag to false would have that effect.      The local list mapping, mapping IRIs to lists If the value is a valid CURIE, then the resulting IRI is used. If the value is an absolute IRI, that value is used. Otherwise, the value is ignored. @vocab supports an IRI. the parent object is set to null; the list of incomplete triples is empty; the list mapping is empty; the language is set to null. the recurse flag is set to 'true'; the skip element flag is set to 'false'; new subject is set to null; current object resource is set to null; typed resource is set to null; A rdfa:Warning MUST be generated when a Term fails to be resolved. rdf:type rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:subPropertyOf owl:equivalentClass References to the other RDFa 1.1 documents, as well as to RDF 1.1 documents, have been updated A minor clarification has been added to section 4.1. to the processors can return processor and output graphs DO NOT use the @vocab feature.

The IANA registration for application/xhtml+xml was accepted during PR, leading to a small update to the corresponding section. "Parsed URL" has been given a proper mapping to the URL specification Improved the informative summary for several elements. (Mostly pointers to tag omission and ARIA rules.) Updated a few references to documents that have seen new revisions (RFC4281, RFC2313, RFC3490, MPEG-DASH) and provided a more stable link to BECSS. Added a note about and made some modifications to the URL reference.

The Protocols and Formats Working Group is no longer chartered to operate. Its work will continue in two new Working Groups: Resources from the PFWG remain available to support long-term institutional memory, but this information is of historical value only. The PFWG holds face-to-face meetings in various locations as needed. Information about upcoming and past meetings is in the PFWG Meetings page. In the past, PFWG meetings were held in W3C Member space; information about those meetings is available in the PFWG Group Meetings page. WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. The work has been divided into a series of modules and related documents.  The current editor's working drafts of these are:  Formal Public Working Drafts of these documents can be found from the WAI-ARIA Overview Page.  Editors' sources for the above specifications are maintained in the W3C ARIA GitHub repository. GitHub users can watch this repository and send pull requests. Media Accessibility User Requiremenst (public editors' draft) aggregates the requirements of an accessibility user that the W3C HTML5 Accessibility Task Force has collected with respect to audio and video on the Web. See also the Public Working Draft of Media Accessibility User Requirements. Editors' sources for the above specification is maintained in the W3C PFWG GitHub repository. GitHub users can watch this repository and send pull requests.  WAI-ARIA 1.0 has been completed. The work has been divided into five documents.  The following documents are W3C Recommendations: The following documents were developed for WAI-ARIA 1.0 but have not been, and are not expected to be, finalized. Role Attribute 1.0 is a W3C Recommendation. The Role Attribute allows the author to annotate markup languages with machine-extractable semantic information about the purpose of an element. Use cases include accessibility, device adaptation, server-side processing, and complex data description. This attribute can be integrated into any markup language. The role attribute is necessary to support WAI-ARIA to define roles in XML-based languages, when the languages do not define their own role attribute.   In addition to the work underway above, the PFWG has been responsible in the past for the incorporation of a number of the accessibility improvements introduced into W3C formats from HTML 4.0 onward including CSS, SMIL, SVG and VoiceXML. Some specific publications developed in service of this work:  Work of the PFWG is in accordance with the W3C Process. PFWG work is funded in part by the WAI Core project. The work of this group does not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the funder. The charter of the working group outlines the goals, work methods, and requirements for participation. It also explains why the working drafts and email archives of this group are in the members-only area. This activity is conducted by the W3C as part of its Web Accessibility Initiative W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a patent.

Describes how user agents determine names and descriptions of accessible objects from web content languages and expose them in accessibility APIs. See also the Public Working Draft of the Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.1.  This document describes how user agents map HTML5.1 [[!HTML51]] elements and attributes to platform accessibility API roles, states and properties on a variety of platforms, based on the Core Accessibility API Mappings [[!CORE-AAM]] specification for user agents. This document is designed to leverage these core mappings for the HTML5.1 host language.

Provides recommended approaches to create accessible Web content using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible. Also describes considerations that might not be evident to most implementors from the WAI-ARIA specification alone.  This paper evaluates the accessibility problems with CAPTCHA, a visual verification system popular on many Web sites, and evaluates a number of more-accessible alternatives to the same problems CAPTCHA claims to solve. This paper suggests a possible implementation of a language annotation system to clarify meaning in potentially ambiguous terms. The discussions for XAG take place on the public wai-xtech list.

The following two productions are modified versions of ones which were present in the first two editions of this specification.

Because the Letter production of XML 1.0, originally used in the definition of NCNameStartChar, is no longer the correct basis for defining names since XML 1.0 Fifth Edition, the NCNameStartChar production has been modified to give the correct results against any edition of XML, by defining NCNameStartChar in terms of NCName.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats.

/+/ ® Groups How to join Permanent Community and Business Groups Quick Links The mission of the Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group (APA WG, formerly part of the Protocols and Formats Working Group) is to ensure W3C specifications provide support for accessibility to people with disabilities. The group advances this mission through review of W3C specifications, development of technical support materials, collaboration with other Working Groups, and coordination of harmonized accessibility strategies within W3C. The mission of the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group (ARIA WG, formerly part of the Protocols and Formats Working Group) is to develop technologies that enhance accessibility of web content for people with disabilities. This includes continued development of the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) suite of technologies and other technical specifications when needed to bridge known gaps. The mission of the Audio Working Group is to define a client-side script API adding more advanced audio capabilities than are currently offered by audio elements. The API will support the features required by advanced interactive applications including the ability to process and synthesize audio streams directly in script. The mission of the Automotive Working Group is to develop Open Web Platform specifications for HTML5/JavaScript application developers enabling Web connectivity through in-vehicle infotainment systems and vehicle data access protocols. The mission of the Browser Testing and Tools Working Group is to produce technologies for use in testing, debugging, and troubleshooting of Web applications running in Web browsers. The mission of the group is to develop and maintain CSS. The mission of the Data on the Web Best Practices  Working Group is (1) to develop the open data ecosystem, facilitating  better communication between developers and publishers; (2) to provide  guidance to publishers that will improve consistency in the way data is  managed, thus promoting the re-use of data; (3) to foster trust in the  data among developers, whatever technology they choose to use,  increasing the potential for genuine innovation. The mission of the Device and Sensors Working Group is to create client-side APIs that enable the development of Web Applications that interact with device hardware, sensors, services and applications such as the camera, microphone, proximity sensors, native address books, calendars and native messaging applications. The mission of the Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG) is to develop strategies, and awareness and training resources, to educate a variety of audiences regarding the need for Web accessibility and approaches to implementing Web accessibility. The main objective of the Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Working Group is to develop a format that allows efficient interchange of the XML Information Set. The mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERT WG) is to develop techniques and resources to facilitate the evaluation and repair of Web sites with regard to their conformance to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, and to facilitate testing across all three WAI guidelines also including the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines and User Agent Accessibility Guidelines. The mission of the Geolocation Working Group is to define a secure and privacy-sensitive interface for using client-side location information in location-aware Web applications. The mission of the HTML Working Group is to continue the evolution of HTML (including classic HTML and XML syntaxes). The mission of the Internationalization Core Working Group is to enable universal access to the World Wide Web by proposing and coordinating the adoption by the W3C of techniques, conventions, technologies, and designs that enable and enhance the use of W3C technology and the Web worldwide, with and between the various different languages, scripts, regions, and cultures. The mission of the Multimodal Interaction Working Group is to develop open standards that extend the Web to allow multiple modes of interaction, e.g., GUI, speech, vision, pen, gestures and haptic interfaces, so that the Web becomes truly accessible for anyone via the user&#039;s preferred modes of interaction with services (=Web for Anyone, Anywhere, Any device and Any time). The mission of the Permissions and Obligations Expression Working Group is to define a semantic data model for expressing permissions and obligations statements for digital content, and to define the technical elements to make it deployable across browsers and content systems. The mission of the Pointer Events Working Group is to provide methods to enable simple device independent input from pointing devices such as mouse, pen, and multi-touch screen. The mission of the RDF Data Shapes Working Group is to produce a language for defining structural constraints on RDF graphs. In the same way that SPARQL made it possible to query RDF data, the product of the RDF Data Shapes WG will enable the definition of graph topologies for interface specification, code development, and data verification. The mission of the Second Screen Presentation Working Group is to provide specifications that enable web pages to use secondary screens to display web content. The mission of the Social Web Working Group, part of the  Social Activity, is to define the techical protocols, vocabularies, and  APIs to facilitate access to social functionality as part of the Open  Web Platform. These technologies should allow communication between  indepedent systems, federation (also called &quot;decentralization&quot;) being  part of the design. The mission of the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group is to clarify and formalize the relevant standards landscape around spatial data on the Web. This includes: (1) to determine how spatial information can best be integrated with other data on the Web; (2) to determine how machines and people can discover that different facts in different datasets relate to the same place, especially when &#039;place&#039; is expressed in different ways and at different levels of granularity; (3) to identify and assess existing methods and tools and then create a set of best practices for their use; (4) where desirable, to complete the standardization of informal technologies already in widespread use. The mission of the SVG Working Group is to continue the evolution of Scalable Vector Graphics as a format and a platform, and enhance the adoption and usability of SVG in combination with other technologies. The mission of the Timed Text Working Group is to develop W3C Recommendations for media online captioning by developing and maintaining new versions of the Timed Text Markup Language (TTML) and WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks) based on implementation experience and interoperability feedback, and the creation of semantic mappings between those languages. The mission of the Tracking Protection Working Group is to improve user privacy and user control by defining mechanisms for expressing user preferences around Web tracking and for blocking or allowing Web tracking elements. The mission of the TV Control Working Group is to provide methods that enable a Web page to browse and control channel-based audio and video sources such as a TV or a radio tuner. The mission of the Web Annotation Working Group, part of the Digital Publishing Activity, is to define a generic data model for Annotations, and define the basic infrastructural elements to make it deployable in browsers and reading systems through suitable user interfaces. The mission of the Web Application Security Working Group is to develop security and policy mechanisms to improve the security of Web Applications, and enable secure cross-site communication. The mission of the Web Authentication Working Group, in the Security Activity is to define a client-side API providing strong authentication functionality to Web Applications.

In particular, the group is responsible for the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 as a W3C Recommendation. The mission of this group is to define an API that lets developers implement secure application protocols on the level of Web applications, including message confidentiality and authentication services, by exposing trusted cryptographic primitives from the browser. Web application developers will no longer have to create their own or use untrusted third-party libraries for cryptographic primitives. This will improve security on the Web. The mission of the Web Payments Working Group is to make payments easier and more secure on the Web. The mission of the Web Performance Working Group is to provide methods to measure aspects of application performance of user agent features and APIs. The mission of the Web Platform Working Group is to continue the development of the HTML language, providing specifications that enable improved client-side application development on the Web, including application programming interfaces (APIs) for client-side development and markup vocabularies for describing and controlling client-side application behavior. The mission of the Web Real-Time Communications Working Group is to define client-side APIs to enable Real-Time Communications in Web browsers. These APIs should enable building applications that can be run inside a browser, requiring no extra downloads or plugins, that allow communication between parties using audio, video and supplementary real-time communication, without having to use intervening servers. The mission of the Web Fonts Working Group is to develop specifications that allow the interoperable deployment of downloadable fonts on the Web. Existing specifications (CSS3 Fonts, SVG) explain how to describe and link to fonts, so the main focus will be the standardisation of font formats suited to the task, and a specification defining conformance (for fonts, authoring tools, viewers, etc.) all the technology required for WebFonts. The mission of the XML Core Working Group is to maintain and develop as needed core XML specifications. The XML Processing Model Working Group is defining XProc, an XML-based language that allows the creator of any given XML document to indicate that operations on that document should be performed in a specific order for a particular result, and if so, how to apply those operations. The mission of the XML Query Working Group is to provide flexible query facilities to extract data from XML and virtual documents, such as contents of databases or other persistent storage that are viewed as XML via a mapping mechanism, on the Web. The mission of the XML Security Working Group is to take the next step in developing the XML security specifications. The mission of the XSL Working Group is to define and maintain a practical style and transformation language capable of supporting the transformation and presentation of, and interaction with, structured information (e.g., XML documents) for use on servers and clients. The language is designed to build transformations in support of browsing, printing, interactive editing, and transcoding of one XML vocabulary into another XML vocabulary. To enhance accessibility, XSL is able to present information both visually and non-visually. XSL is not intended to replace CSS, but will provide functionality beyond that defined by CSS, for example, element re-ordering. The mission of the Digital Publishing Interest Group is to provide a forum for experts in the digital publishing ecosystem of electronic journals, magazines, news, or book publishing (authors, creators, publishers, news organizations, booksellers, accessibility and internationalization specialists, etc.) for technical discussions, gathering use cases and requirements to align the existing formats and technologies (e.g., for electronic books) with those used by the Open Web Platform. The goal is to ensure that the requirements of digital publishing can be answered, when in scope, by the Recommendations published by W3C. This group is not chartered to publish Recommendations; instead, the goal is to cooperate with the relevant W3C Working Groups to ensure that the requirements of this particular community are met. The mission of the HTML5 Chinese Interest Group is to facilitate focused discussion in Chinese of the HTML5 specification and of specifications closely related to HTML5, to gather comments and questions in Chinese about those specifications, to collect information about specific use cases in Chinese speaking region for technologies defined in those specifications, and to report the results of its activities as a group back to the HTML Working Group, as well as to other relevant groups and to the W3C membership and community. The mission of the Internationalization (I18n) Interest Group, part of the Internationalization Activity, is to help the Working Groups within the Internationalization Activity and provides a forum to discuss issues related to the internationalization of the Web. The Internationalization Tag Set Interest Group is a forum to foster a community of users of the Internationalization Tag Set (ITS), by promoting its adoption, and gathering information on its further development. The Patent and Standards Interest Group (PSIG) is a forum for W3C Members and Invited Experts to discuss policy issues regarding the implementation of the W3C Patent Policy as well as new Patent-related questions that arise which require action or attention from the W3C Membership. The PSIG has no authority to create new policy. However, input from the PSIG on the operation of the policy and areas that might require further policy development by a W3C Working Group is welcome. The mission of the Privacy Interest Group, part of the Privacy Activity, is to improve the support of privacy in Web standards by monitoring ongoing privacy issues that affect the Web, investigating potential areas for new privacy work, and providing guidelines and advice for addressing privacy in standards development. The mission of the Semantic Web Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group is to develop, advocate for, and support the use of Semantic Web technologies for health care and life science, with focus on biological science and translational medicine. These domains stand to gain tremendous benefit by adoption of Semantic Web technologies, as they depend on the interoperability of information from many domains and processes for efficient decision support. The Semantic Web Interest Group is a forum for W3C Members and non-Members to discuss innovative Semantic Web applications. The group will focus primarily on applications of the W3C Semantic Web technologies (RDF, OWL, SPARQL, etc), on potential future work items related to technologies, and the relationship of that work to other activities of W3C and to the broader social and legal context in which the Web is situated.

/+/ &#xAE; The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user’s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.

/+/ &#xAE; The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#8217;s Emmy® award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#8217;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats.

A Document Instance that conforms to a profile defined herein: A presentation processor that conforms to a profile defined in this specification: A transformation processor that conforms to a profile defined in this specification: Notwithstanding special cases, e.g. a Document Instance that contains no p, span, br element and no smpte:backgroundImage attribute, it is generally not possible to construct a Document Instance that conforms to the Text Profile and Image Profile simultaneously, and it is not possible to construct a Document Instance that results in the presentation of both text data and image data. The Text Profile consists of Sections 6. Common Constraints and 7. Text Profile Constraints. The Image Profile consists of Sections 6. Common Constraints and 8. Image Profile Constraints. A Document Instance SHALL use UTF-8 character encoding as specified in [UNICODE]. A transformation processor SHOULD preserve such elements or attributes whenever possible. The following namespaces (see [xml-names]) are used in this specification: The namespaces defined by this specification are mutable [namespaceState]; all undefined names in these namespaces are reserved for future standardization by the W3C. A Document Instance MAY be associated with a Related Video Object. The ittp:aspectRatio attributes allows authorial control of the mapping of the root container of a Document Instance to each image frame of the Related Video Object. If present, the ittp:aspectRatio attribute SHALL conform to the following syntax: A progressively decodable Document Instance is a Document Instance that conforms to the following: If present, the ittp:progressivelyDecodable attribute SHALL conform to the following syntax: If not specified, the value of ittp:progressivelyDecodable SHALL be considered to be equal to "false". itts:forcedDisplay can be used to hide content whose computed value of tts:visibility is "visible" when the processor has been configured to do so via the application parameter displayForcedOnlyMode. The itts:forcedDisplay attribute SHALL conform to the following: The ittm:altText element SHALL conform to the following syntax: The ittm:altText element SHALL be a child of the metadata element. 8. Image Profile Constraints specifies the use of the ittm:altText element with images. A presented region is a temporally active region that satisfies the following conditions: The number of presented regions in a given intermediate synchronic document SHALL NOT be greater than 4. It SHALL be possible to apply the Hypothetical Render Model specified in Section 9. Hypothetical Render Model to any sequence of consecutive intermediate synchronic documents without error as defined in Section 9.2 General. See 4. Conformance for a definition of permitted and prohibited. This profile is associated with the following profile designator: A Document Instance SHOULD be authored using characters selected from the sets specified in B. Recommended Character Sets. See 4. Conformance for a definition of permitted and prohibited. The initial value of tts:color SHALL be "white". If the computed value of tts:fontFamily is "default", then the used value of tts:fontFamily SHALL be "monospaceSerif". The processor: The processor: This profile is associated with the following profile designator: A presented image is a div element with a smpte:backgroundImage attribute that flows into a presented region. In a given intermediate synchronic document, each presented region SHALL contain at most one div element, which SHALL be a presented image. For the purposes of constructing an intermediate synchronic document, a div element with a smpte:backgroundImage attribute SHALL NOT be considered empty. If a smpte:backgroundImage attribute is applied to a div element: See 4. Conformance for a definition of permitted and prohibited.  Similarly, Decoded Image Buffers Dn and Dn-1 store decoded images across intermediate synchronic documents, allowing images to be copied into the Presentation Buffer instead of decoded. The Presentation Compositor SHALL start rendering En: where Unless specified otherwise, the following table SHALL specify values for IPD and BDraw. where CLEAR(E0) = 0 and CLEAR(En | n &gt; 0) = 1, i.e. the root container in its entirety. NSIZE(Ri) SHALL be given by: For each presented image, the Presentation Compositor SHALL either: Two images SHALL be identical if and only if they reference the same encoded image source. where NRGA(Ii) is the Normalized Image Area of presented image Ii and SHALL be equal to: NSIZ(Ii) SHALL be the number of pixels of presented image Ii. Unless specified otherwise, the following table SHALL specify ICpy, IDec, and NDBIS. where The Normalized Rendered Glyph Area NRGA(gi) of a glyph gi SHALL be equal to: Unless specified otherwise, the following table specifies values of GCpy, Ren and NGBS. Some of these sets overlap. In order to meet the guidelines in [WCAG20], the following considerations apply. The following sample Document Instances conforms to the Text Profile and Image Profile, respectively. These samples are for illustration only, and are neither intended to capture current or future practice, nor exercise all normative prose contained in this specification. These definitions are non-normative and are not sufficient to validate conformance of a Document Instance. This section documents extensibility objectives for this specification. This specification is intended to allow: This specification is also intended to allow straightforward conversion of a document that conforms to the text or image profiles of [CFF] to the Text Profile or Image Profile, respectively. The Text Profile is a strict syntactic superset of [EBU-TT-D]. A document that conforms to [EBU-TT-D] therefore generally also conforms to the Text Profile, with a few exceptions, including: Note that the ttp:profile attribute is not allowed by [EBU-TT-D], and the ebuttm:conformsToStandard element is used instead to signal Text Profile, as specified in 6.9 Profile Signaling. It is not possible for a document that conforms to [EBU-TT-D] to also conform to Image Profile, and vice-versa, notwithstanding the special case where the document also conforms to Text Profile as noted at 5. Profiles. The following is an example of a document that conforms to both Text Profile and [EBU-TT-D]. Note the presence of two ebuttm:conformsToStandard elements, one of which equals the Text Profile designator: The Text Profile is a strict syntactic superset of [ttml10-sdp-us]. A document that conforms to [ttml10-sdp-us] therefore also generally conforms to the Text Profile, with a few exceptions, including: It is not possible for a document that conforms to [ttml10-sdp-us] to also conform to Image Profile, and vice-versa, notwithstanding the special case where the document also conforms to Text Profile as noted at 5. Profiles. As an illustration, Example 3 at [ttml10-sdp-us] conforms to both Text Profile and [ttml10-sdp-us]. [ST2052-1] specifies the use of the DFXP Full Profile (see Appendix F.3 at [TTML1]) supplemented by a number of extensions, including http://www.smpte-ra.org/schemas/2052-1/2010/smpte-tt#image. This specification defines practical constraints on [ST2052-1], supplemented by a few extensions defined at F. Extensions. These constraints and extensions are intended to reflect industry practice. As a result, particular care is required when creating a document intended to be processed according to both [ST2052-1] and Text Profile or Image Profile. In particular: The following is an example of a document that conforms to both Text Profile and [ST2052-1]: This version: Latest published version: Latest editor's draft: Previous version: Editor: http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/REC-ttml-imsc1-20160421/ http://www.w3.org/TR/ttml-imsc1/ https://rawgit.com/w3c/imsc1/master/spec/ttml-ww-profiles.html http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/PR-ttml-imsc1-20160308/ SHALL satisfy all normative provisions specified by the profile; SHALL satisfy the Generic Processor Conformance requirements at Section 3.2.1 of [TTML1]; SHALL satisfy all normative provisions specified by the profile; and SHALL satisfy the Generic Processor Conformance requirements at Section 3.2.1 of [TTML1]; SHALL satisfy all normative provisions specified by the profile; and the ratio of the width to the height of the rectangular area is equal to ittp:aspectRatio, the center of the rectangular area is collocated with the center of the image frame, the rectangular area is entirely within the image frame, and the rectangular area has a height or width equal to that of the image frame. no attribute or element of the TTML timing vocabulary is present within the head element; no attribute of the TTML timing vocabulary is present on a descendant element of p; and no element E1 explicitly references another element E2 where the opening tag of E2 is lexically subsequent to the opening tag of E1. the computed value of tts:opacity is not equal to "0.0"; and the computed value of tts:display is not "none"; and the computed value of tts:visibility is not "hidden"; and SHALL apply ebutts:linePadding to p only; and SHALL treat ebutts:linePadding as inheritable. SHALL apply ebutts:multiRowAlign to p only; and SHALL treat ebutts:multiRowAlign as inheritable. the div element SHOULD contain a metadata element containing an ittm:altText element that is a Text Alternative of the image referenced by the smpte:backgroundImage attribute; and The smpte:backgroundImage attribute SHALL reference a PNG datastream as specified in [PNG]. If a pHYs chunk is present, it SHALL indicate square pixels. Note that if no pixel aspect ratio is carried, the default of square pixels is assumed. smpte:backgroundImage MAY be used according to 8.3 smpte:backgroundImage Constraints with the semantics of the attribute defined by Section 5.5.2 of [ST2052-1]. smpte:backgroundImageHorizontal and smpte:backgroundImageVertical SHALL NOT be used. smpte:image SHALL NOT be used. paint, according to stacking order, all background pixels for each region; paint all pixels for background colors associated with text or image subtitle content; and paint the text or image subtitle content. at the presentation time of E0 minus Initial Painting Delay (IPD), if n = 0; or at the presentation time of En-1, if n &gt; 0. BDraw is the normalized background drawing performance factor; it is specified on the region layout element that defines the region; or IDec is the image decoding rate; and ICpy is the normalized image copy performance factor. tts:color tts:fontFamily tts:fontSize tts:fontStyle tts:fontWeight tts:textDecoration tts:textOutline Ren(gi) is the text rendering performance factor for glyph gi; and GCpy is the normalized glyph copy performance factor. the main exemplar character set specified for the language in [CLDR] as well as any corresponding uppercase characters as specified in [UNICODE]; and the punctuation exemplar character set specified for the language in [CLDR]; the digits and symbols included in all numberSystems specified for the language in [CLDR]; the common character set specified in Table 1; and supplementary characters specified for the language in Table 2, if any. other profiles of TTML and future revisions of this specification to specify support for documents and/or processors conforming to Text Profile or Image Profile, in addition to specifying additional extensions; subject to the structural requirements of [TTML1], content from external namespaces to be present in a document that conforms to Text Profile or Image Profile (a) without affecting transformation or presentation, and (b) to be carried through by a transformation processor (see 6.2 Foreign Element and Attributes); a document that conforms to Text Profile or Image Profile to be embedded in other XML documents. conforms to one of [ST2052-1], [EBU-TT-D] or [ttml10-sdp-us], and also conforms to Text Profile; or conforms to [ST2052-1], and also conforms to Image Profile. [EBU-TT-D] does not constrain document complexity using an HRM; [EBU-TT-D] recommends use of UTF-8 encoding but allows alternate encodings; and [EBU-TT-D] does not constrain the number of presented regions in a given intermediate synchronic document. [ttml10-sdp-us] does not constrain document complexity using an HRM. in contrast to Text Profile and Image Profile, [ST2052-1] allows documents to contain both smpte:backgroundImage attributes and any of p, span, or br elements; Image Profile allows only a subset of the http://www.smpte-ra.org/schemas/2052-1/2010/smpte-tt#image extension; when the designator "http://www.smpte-ra.org/schemas/2052-1/2010/profiles/smpte-tt-full" is used as a value for ttp:profile element or attribute (see Section 5.8 at [ST2052-1]), Text Profile or Image Profile is signaled by the Document Interchange Context and/or the Document Processing Context. the namespace of the progressivelyDecodable attribute is different; the [CFF] HRM does not specifies GCpy as a function of

The tts:bpd style is illustrated by the following example.  The tts:color style is illustrated by the following example.  The tts:direction style is illustrated by the following example.  When rendering a region on the right (left) image of a stereoscopic image pair, the center of the region is offset along the horizontal axis by a value equal to ½ (-½) the computed value of tts:disparity, where a positive offset is to the right, and a negative offset is to the left. Unless rendering onto a steroscopic image pair, the tts:disparity attribute is ignored for the purpose of presentation processing. The author should ensure that the perceived depth of a region is positioned in front of any object in the scene during the entire time the region is visible. The stereoscopic effect will be broken if an object in the scene is perceived to be in front of the region. The tts:disparity style is illustrated by the following example fragment and rendition. Note that, in typical television scenarios, disparity ranges from -1% to 2% of screen width. This example, which uses a disparity of 5%, exaggerates the effects of disparity for clarity of illustration.  The tts:display style is illustrated by the following example.  The tts:displayAlign style is illustrated by the following example.

The tts:overflow style is illustrated by the following example.  The &lt;length&gt; value(s) used to express padding must be non-negative. The tts:padding style is illustrated by the following example.  When rendering spans to which padding applies, the padding applies to each generated line area independently.   When using tts:ruby, the following nesting constraints apply:    If a presentation processor does not support ruby presentation, then it must perform fallback ruby presentaton. The above listed constraints are intended to be interpreted as specifying the following nesting model: Whereas, in TTML2, the following alternative expressions are possible: or its equivalent Use of tts:ruby to specify simple ruby annotation is illustrated by the following example.  Use of tts:ruby to specify complex ruby annotation is illustrated by the following example.  The tts:rubyAlign attribute is used to specify the position of ruby text within the inline area generated by the ruby text container annotation.   Negative length expressions are permitted.  When inseting ruby text or base text in order to resolve a potential overflow scenario, only the minimum (non-negative) inset is applied.   If specified, the value of tts:rubyOverhangClass expresses constraints on which base characters allow ruby text to overhang them.    If the &lt;length&gt; component is specified, it must be non-negative.  The tts:showBackground style is illustrated by the following example. The tts:textAlign style is illustrated by the following example.     Combination must not cross an element boundary, a bidirectional boundary, or a non-glyph area boundary. This attribute has no impact on or interaction with the nominal layout of glyph areas that constitute a Unicode combining character sequence. The tts:textDecoration style is illustrated by the following example.  If a vertical writing mode does not apply, then this style property has no effect. The &lt;length&gt; value(s) used to express thickness and blur radius must be non-negative.  If multiple text shadows apply, then they are drawn in the specified order immediately prior to drawing the glyph area to which they apply.

The semantics of text emphasis style values are defined as follows: No text emphasis mark. Emphasis mark is filled with emphasis color. Emphasis mark is not filled, i.e., its outline is stroked with the emphasis color, but it is not filled. Emphasis mark is a circle. If filled, then equivalent to U+25CF '●'; if open, then equivalent to U+25CB '○' Emphasis mark is a dot. If filled, then equivalent to U+2022 '•'; if open, then equivalent to U+25E6 '◦' Emphasis mark is a sesame. If filled, then equivalent to U+FE45 '﹅'; if open, then equivalent to U+FE46 '﹆' Emphasis mark is the first grapheme cluster of string, with remainder of string ignored. If only filled or open is specified, then it is equivalent to filled circle and open circle, respectively. A &lt;family-name&gt; expression specifies a font family name. In addition to adhering to the syntax rules specified above, the following semantic rules apply: the semantic value of an escape non-terminal is the value of the escaped char; For the purpose of parsing, a distinction must not be made between lower and upper case. An &lt;integer&gt; expression is used to express an arbitrary, signed integral value.

/+/ &#xAE; The W3C Social Web Working Group is calling for implementations of Webmention, which is now a Candidate Recommendation. Webmention provides a mechanism for a website to notify other websites that it has content which links to them and when the source content changes or is deleted. This mechanism is a core building block for a decentralized (social) Web because it allows sites to automatically learn about connected content without any prior setup or agreement. For users, an immediate benefit is cross-site comments. Before being brought to W3C for standardization, Webmention already had twenty-seven independent implementations in the IndieWebCamp community.

This section is non-normative.  This section is non-normative. Webmention implementations are either senders or receivers. This section describes the conformance criteria for both. Listed below are known types of Webmention implementations. The conformance criteria for Webmention senders is described in Sending Webmentions The conformance criteria for Webmention receivers is described in Receiving Webmentions For this specification to exit the CR stage, there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of products. There is no requirement that all features be implemented by a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the following terms: A Webmention Sender is an implementation that sends Webmentions, the conformance criteria are described in Sending Webmentions. In order to send a Webmention, the Sender first creates a document at a URL that is accessible to the Receiver. A Webmention Receiver is an implementation that receives Webmentions to one or more target URLs on which the Receiver's Webmention endpoint is advertised. The conformance criteria for Receivers are described in Receiving Webmentions. In order to receive a Webmention, there must be a URL that advertises the Receiver's Webmention endpoint. The URL is not considered part of the Receiver's implementation, as it may exist in an entirely different system or domain. Each implementation must be developed by a different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are exempt from this requirement. A Sender and Receiver implementation are considered interoperable for a specific feature when the Sender 1) can discover the Webmention endpoint for the target URL for all specified ways of finding the endpoint (allowing the Receiver to change the way the endpoint is advertised without changing the Sender implementation), and 2) considers the Webmention request successful for all specified ways a Receiver may indicate success. An Implementation is a Webmention Sender or Receiver which meets all of the following criteria: For the purposes of evaluating exit criteria, each of the following is considered a feature: Please submit your implementation reports at http://webmention.net/implementation-reports/. Instructions are provided at the URL. The implementation report template references the tests available at webmention.rocks. webmention.rocks provides many test cases you can use to live-test your implementation. It also is a good tool to use while developing a Webmention implementation, as it provides detailed responses when errors are encountered.   Any 2xx response code MUST be considered a success.   When sending a Webmention when a post is updated, the sender MUST re-discover the Webmention endpoint of each target URL, in case the target has updated their Webmention endpoint. If a response to the source URL is shown on the source URL page (e.g. as a comment), then sender SHOULD treat that as an update of the source URL and re-send any previously sent Webmentions.     The receiver MUST reject the request if the source URL is the same as the target URL.      It is possible for an attacker to advertise a Webmention endpoint that points to an arbitrary URL. As such, if you install software that sends Webmentions on a server that is behind a firewall or otherwise has access to normally protected resources, you should be aware that an attacker can cause the server to send a POST request to an internal server. You SHOULD take precautions to ensure this server cannot access protected resources by either: If your implementation wants to treat the source and target parameters as URIs, you can prefix the terms with http://www.w3.org/ns/webmention#. This section is non-normative. The following Webmention Extension Specifications have 2+ interoperable implementations live on the web and are thus listed here: The [Vouch] protocol is an anti-spam extension to Webmention. The [Salmention] protocol is an extension to Webmention to propagate comments and other interactions upstream. This section is non-normative.  This section is non-normative.

Bob sees this content and comments about it on his site, linking back to Alice's original post. Using Webmention, Bob's publishing software automatically notifies Alice's server that her post has been linked to by the URL of Bob's post. Alice's publishing software verifies that Bob's post actually contains a link to her post and then includes this information on her site. User Aaron writes a post on his blog. User Barnaby writes a post on his blog that links to Aaron's post. After publishing the post (i.e., after it has a URL), Barnaby's server notices the link to Aaron's post as part of the publishing process. Barnaby's server does Webmention discovery on Aaron's post to find its Webmention endpoint (if not found, process stops). source set to Barnaby's post's permalink target set to Aaron's post's permalink. Aaron's server receives the Webmention. Aaron's server verifies that target in the Webmention is a valid permalink on Aaron's blog (if not, processing stops). Aaron's server verifies that the source in the Webmention (when retrieved, after following redirects [FETCH]) contains a hyperlink to the target (if not, processing stops).

If it received a 410 Gone status code on step 2 (performing a GET request on source), or received a 200 OK status code and does not find a link to target on source, it SHOULD delete the existing Webmention, or mark it as deleted. Processing Webmentions SHOULD be idempotent. That is, receiving multiple Webmentions for the same source and target with no content changes should not show as multiple replies. The verification process SHOULD be queued and processed asynchronously to prevent DoS attacks. Receivers MAY moderate Webmentions before displaying them. Receivers MAY periodically re-verify Webmentions and update them.

/+/ right now Compagnietheater, Amsterdam CSS Day is a two-day advanced web development conference, one day about CSS, and one day about HTML. Thursday 16th of June - eight speakers - eight HTML tags The new HTML Special, on Thursday 16th of June, treats a few advanced HTML5 topics such as iframes, links, and SVG. Don't expect basic sessions, by the way; we kind-of assume that our attendees already know how HTML works, and that they prefer to hear about edge cases, odd circumstances, and advanced tips and tricks. HTML Special will be hosted by Ruben Bos. Friday 17th of June - eight speakers - eight CSS topics The actual CSS Day, on Friday 17th of June, is in its fourth year now. Frequent visitors know the score: geeky nerding about CSS topics you were only vaguely aware of, but end up wanting to use in your projects right now.

/+/ Porto Alegre, 26 e 27 maior conferência JavaScript do mundo para a edição 2016 Edição Olimpíadas dias horas min sec Nós somos a maior conferência JavaScript do universo! E queremos ser ainda maior! A ideia do BrazilJS surgiu em meados do ano de 2008. Muitos eventos de tecnologia e de diversas linguagens estavam acontecendo na época. Jaydson e Felipe sempre foram entusiastas JavaScript, e sentiram a falta de uma conferência focada na linguagem, que para eles, tinha um futuro promissor. Pouco tempo depois, em 2009, nasceu a primeira conferência JavaScript, a JSConf americana. Durante o ano de 2010 a ideia evoluiu e Christiano Milfont estava pensando no mesmo, fazer uma conferência JavaScript nacional. Unindo forças, Jaydson, Felipe e Christiano conseguiram em 2011 fazer a primeira conferência JavaScript do Brasil. Na sua estréia, em maio de 2011, a BrazilJS Conf se tornou uma das maiores conferências JavaScript do mundo, contando com 600 participantes e mais de 20 palestras. Em 2012, a BrazilJS Conf contou com mais de 900 pessoas e trouxe pela primeira vez ao Brasil o lendário criador da linguagem JavaScript, Brendan Eich. Em 2013 e 2014, a conferência repetiu o sucesso. Com nomes de peso, como Douglas Crockford, Yehuda Katz, Guillermo Rauch e Mr. Doob, o número de participantes chegou a quase 1000 em ambas edições, lotando o teatro onde a conferência foi realizada. O ano 2015 foi especial. Além de ser o 20º aniversário do JavaScript, foi também  a nossa 5º edição com mais de 1300 participantes, Brendan Eich, nomes mundiais, um bolo gigante de aniversário e uma hilária entrada triunfal dos Power Rangers. 2016 é o ano das olimpíadas e queremos fazer um evento grandioso onde você será o medalhista de ouro. Estamos preparando uma estrutura fantástica, além é claro, ótimas palestras e o encontro com toda a comunidade brasileira. Mais de 1300 pessoas lotaram o auditório do BarraSul Shopping na nossa 5ª edição em comemoração aos 20 anos do JavaScript. Primeiros palestrantes confirmados para a edição 2016 Conheça o nosso manifesto Helen Holmes Lea Verou Talita Pagani Mattias P Johansson Jake Archibald Sérgio Lopes Chris Lilley Flávio Ribeiro BrazilJS 2016

/+/ experiences impact interoperability requirements A workshop endorsed by W3C at Provenance Week, June 6, 2016, Washington DC. In 2013, the World Wide Web Consortium published PROV, a standard for expressing, sharing, and discovering provenance on the Web. It consists of a conceptual data model (PROV-DM), an OWL2 ontology (PROV-O), a textual notation (PROV-N), a set of constraints to check the consistency of provenance (PROV-CONSTRAINTS), an XML schema (PROV-XML), conventions for sharing and discovering provenance (PROV-AQ), and various other more focused specifications. Since then, PROV has seen adoption in some flagship applications, continued strong interest by the academic community, and promising tentative take-up in other standardization organizations, such as HL7 and OGC. Three years later, it is time for provenance practitioners to take stock, reflect on their practical experiences with using PROV in their applications, understand the impact of PROV, and identify interoperability challenges and shortcomings with the current specifications. We invite the community to submit short position statements, which will be presented in "lightning talks" at a workshop on June 6, during Provenance Week. Talks will be grouped by topics of interest. The workshop organisers will act as facilitators, with the aim to develop a community consensus around the priorities for PROV. Position statements will be published online as a record of the workshop. The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics for position statements reporting on interoperability and requirements: Authors are strongly encouraged, where appropriate, to make an explicit link between requirements and application needs.

Sponsorship package info Many projects and companies are looking at ways to use the Bitcoin blockchain or other public or private distributed ledgers, to record an immutable timestamped public record that can be independently verified by any stakeholder. What does this mean for Web technologies, beyond payments? What emerging capabilities could blockchains enable for the Web, such as distributed identity management? Conversely, should features be added to the Web Platform and to browsers to enable blockchain use cases, such as a JavaScript blockchain API to write to blockchain nodes? With the proliferation of different approaches and technology stacks (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger), is there a need for interchange formats, protocols, or APIs to share transaction data across services and stacks or between public and private networks? What will help Web developers to take advantage of blockchains? When we talk about blockchains as “part of the Web”, we face some specific questions: How does this fit into the same origin security model of the Web? What are the privacy implications, especially when talking about identity management? What part of the Web stack would be involved: client-side, server-side, protocols, interchange formats? What is the relationship to payments, including W3C's Web Payments work? These are questions this workshop aims to answer, and we are seeking blockchain and Web experts to gather together to discuss what needs to happen to integrate blockchains into the Web. This is an exploratory workshop; our goal is to start the conversation in the context of features for the Web, and to review critical questions for incubation. We do not foresee immediate standardization work. We currently have a limit of only 60 attendees at the workshop. We want to fill the room with deep knowledge about blockchain and the Web, with positive and productive energy, and with imaginative minds that can apply lessons learned about blockchain to the Web stack. We won't just be listening to presentations, but will be actively participating in topic breakouts and working discussions. If you want to participate, please fill out the expression of interest form or submit a position statement. Please note, expressions of interest and position statements are not presentation proposals. This is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short, with topics suggested by expressions of interest and decided by the chairs and program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations. Attendees are encouraged to read all accepted expressions of interest prior to the workshop, to facilitate informed discussion. Attendance is free for all invited participants, and open to the public, whether or not W3C members. Unfortunately, the workshop budget does not allow us to provide travel or lodging expenses to attendees. Possible topics include, but are not limited to the following: A position statement is not required to attend (you can fill out the expression of interest form instead), but it does help set the topic discussions and to establish a particular point of view. If you wish, you can send us a position statement at &lt;team-blockchain-submission@w3.org&gt;, by 3 June 2016. Our program committee will review the expressions of interest, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives. A good position statement should be a few paragraphs (between 500 and 1000 words) and should include: Position statements must be in English, and HTML or plain-text format; images should be included inline in HTML using base64-encoded data URIs. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. All suitable submitted expressions of interest will be published and linked to from this workshop page. Attendance is open to all, and our aim is to get a diversity of attendees from a variety of industries and communities, including: There are a lot of voices and conflicting opinions in the blockchain communities. Are you skeptical that standardization should be discussed at all? We also welcome expressions of interest on issues that pose challenges to standardization, helpful to frame workshop topics and serve as a reality check. Please label these submissions “Standards Con” to distinguish them. For posterity and for those unable to attend this workshop, we may be recording video and/or audio of the event, and will provide live notes (minuted in IRC) of the presentations and group discussion. Participants will be asked to sign a media waiver. The goal of the workshop is exploratory. One of the primary outcomes is to bring different voices and perspectives together. While we hope to identify opportunities and possible timelines for standardization, we do not anticipate that W3C will form a Working Group as a direct result of this workshop. Instead, if we do identify areas that need Web standardization, our aim would be to incubate and refine these ideas, to make sure that the right steps are taken at the right time for the key stakeholders involved. W3C is a voluntary standards consortium that convenes companies and communites to help structure productive discussions around existing and emerging technologies, and offers a Royalty-Free patent framework for Web Recommendations. We focus primarily on client-side (browser) technologies, and also have a mature history of vocabulary (or “ontology”) development. W3C develops work based on the priorities of our members and our community. Room E14, 6th floor W3C has not negotiated special prices with any hotels, but we have identified these reasonably-priced hotels within walking distance of the venue: Attendees may also wish to check local bed-and-breakfast options nearby. The nearest airport is the San Francisco International Airport (SFO). Map to venue The workshop will focus around several topics identified by the expressions of interest. Each topic will be introduced by one or more related lightning talks, and will be explored more in-depth by discussion breakouts, conlcuded with joint summaries of the breakouts. The goal of the discussion is not be to resolve the technical issues of the topic, but to determine its relevance and priority to standardization. This schedule may change based on discussions with the program commitee.    For details on the available sponsorship opportunities for this workshop, see our Sponsorship Packages.

/+/ Cancel reply &#xAE; Finishing HTML5.1 … and starting HTML 5.2 Since we published the Working on HTML5.1 post, we&#8217;ve made progress. We&#8217;ve closed more issues than we have open, we now have a working rhythm for the specification that is getting up to the speed we want, and we have a spec we think is a big improvement on HTML5. Now it&#8217;s time to publish something serious. We&#8217;ve just posted a Call For Consensus (CFC) to publish the current HTML5.1 Working Draft as a Candidate Recommendation (CR). This means we&#8217;re going into feature freeze on HTML5.1, allowing the W3C Patent Policy to come into play and ensure HTML5.1 can be freely implemented and used. While HTML5.1 is in CR we may make some editorial tweaks to the spec &#8211; for instance we will be checking for names that have been left out of the Acknowledgements section. There will also be some features marked &#8220;at risk&#8221;, which means they will be removed from HTML5.1 if we find during CR that they do not work in at least two shipping browsers. Beyond this, the path of getting from CR to W3C Recommendation is an administrative one. We hope the Web Platform WG agrees that HTML5.1 is better than HTML5, and that it would benefit the web community if we updated the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; &#8211; the W3C Recommendation. Then we need W3C&#8217;s membership, and finally W3C Director Tim Berners Lee to agree too. The goal is for HTML5.1 to be a W3C Recommendation in September, and to achieve that we have to put the specification into feature freeze now. But what happens between now and September? Are we really going to sit around for a few months crossing legal t&#8217;s and dotting administrative i&#8217;s? No way! We have pending changes that reflect features we believe will be shipped over the next few months. And of course there are always bugs to fix, and editorial improvements to make HTML at W3C more reliable and usable by the web community. In the next couple of weeks we will propose a First Public Working Draft of HTML5.2. This will probably include some new features, some features that were not interoperable and so not included in HTML5.1, and some more bug fixes. This will kick off a programme of regular Working Draft releases until HTML5.2 is ready to be moved to W3C Recommendation sometime in the next year or so As always please join in, whether by following @HTMLWG on Twitter, filing issues, joining WP WG and writing bits of the specification, or just helping your colleagues stay up to date on HTML&#8230; … on behalf of the chairs and editors, thanks!

/+/ Jose Kahan from W3C&#8217;s Systems Team adds Cancel reply https not sure &#xAE; HTTPS and the Semantic Web/Linked Data As we hope you&#8217;ve noticed, W3C is increasing the security of its own Web site and is strongly encouraging everyone to do the same. I&#8217;ve included some details from our systems team below for an explanation but the key technologies to look into if you&#8217;re interested are Http Strict Transport Security (HSTS) and Upgrade-Insecure-Requests (UIR). Bottom line: we want everyone to use HTTPS and there are smarts in place on our servers and in many browsers to take care of the upgrade automatically. So what of Semantic Web URIs, particularly namespaces like http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#? Visit that URI in a modern, secure browser and you&#8217;ll be redirected to https://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#. Older browsers and, in this context more importantly, other user agents that do not recognize HSTS and/or UIR will not be redirected. So you can go on using http://www.w3.org namespaces without disruption. This raises a number of questions. Firstly, is the community agreed that if two URIs differ only in the scheme (http://, https:// and perhaps whatever comes in future) then they identify the same resource? We believe that this can only be asserted by the domain owner. In the specific case of http://www.w3.org/* we do make that assertion. Note that this does not necessarily apply to any current or future subdomains of w3.org. Secondly, some members of the Semantic Web community have already moved to HTTPS (it was a key motivator for w3id.org). How steep is the path from where we are today to moving to a more secure Semantic Web, i.e. one that habitually uses HTTPS rather than HTTP? Have you/are you considering upgrading your own software? Until and if the Semantic Web operates on more secure connections, we will need to be careful to pass around http URIs &#8211; which is likely to mean remembering to knock off the s when pasting a URI from your browser. That&#8217;s a royal pain but we&#8217;ve looked at various workarounds and they&#8217;re all horrible. For example, we could deliberately redirect requests to things like our vocabulary namespaces away from the secure w3.org site to a deliberately less secure sub-domain &#8211; gah! No thanks. Thirdly, a key feature of the HSTS/UIR landscape is that there is no need to go back and edit old resources &#8211; communication is carried out using HTTPS without further intervention. Can this be true for Semantic Web/Linked Data too or should we be considering more drastic action. For example, editing definitions in turtle files such as the one at http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat# to make it explicit that http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Dataset is owl:equivalentClass to https://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Dataset (or even worse, having to go through and actually duplicate all the definitions with the different subject). I really hope point 3 is unnecessary &#8211; but I&#8217;d like to be sure it is. Jose Kahan from W3C&#8217;s Systems Team adds HSTS does the client side upgrade from HTTP to HTTPS for a given domain. However, that header is only sent when doing an HTTPS connection. UIR defines a header that, if sent by browser, will tell the server it prefers using HTTPS and the server will redirect to HTTPS, then HSTS (through the header in the response) will kick in. HSTS doesn&#8217;t handle the case of mixed-content. That is the other part that UIR does to complement HSTS: tell the browser to update URLs of all content associated with a resource to HTTPS before requesting it. For browser UAs, if HSTS is enabled for a domain and you browse a document by typing its URL on the navigation bar or follow a link to a new document, the request will be sent as HTTPS, regardless  of the URL saying HTTP. If the document includes a CSS file, javascript, or an image, for example and that URL is HTTP, the request for those resources will only be sent as HTTPS if the UA supports UIR. &gt; is the community agreed that if two URIs differ only in the scheme (http://, https:// and perhaps whatever comes in future) then they identify the same resource? Yes, though it is a &#8220;SHOULD&#8221; rather than a &#8220;MUST&#8221;.  If a URI owner treats them as identifying different resources, then that URI owner is being unhelpful to the community. In short, keep writing &#8220;http:&#8221; and trust that the infrastructure will quietly switch over to TLS (https) whenever both client and server can handle it.   Meanwhile, let&#8217;s try to get SemWeb software to be doing TLS+UIR+HSTS and be as secure as modern browsers. The W3C blog is for discussions within W3C and the Web community at large.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats. You may read more in the press release.    W3C plans to update its site privacy policy shortly after 14 April. No material changes are intended in the new privacy policy. Here No open positions at this time. Check out our short video on Web standards! Oracle is committed to preserving the open standards-based philosophy that has made the World Wide Web so successful.  We believe the W3C's open, consensus-driven process and associated rigorous public reviews make it uniquely positioned to guide the Web's technical evolution.

A list of current W3C Recommendations and other technical documents can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR. This section is informative. XML&#8482; is the shorthand name for Extensible Markup Language [XML]. While retaining these beneficial features, XML removes many of the more complex features of SGML that make the authoring and design of suitable software both difficult and costly. The benefits of migrating to XHTML 1.0 are described above. Some of the benefits of migrating to XHTML in general are: This section is normative. This section is normative. A Strictly Conforming XHTML Document is an XML document that requires only the facilities described as mandatory in this specification. Such a document must meet all of the following criteria: It must conform to the constraints expressed in one of the three DTDs found in DTDs and in Appendix B. The root element of the document must be html. The DTD subset must not be used to override any parameter entities in the DTD. The following example shows the way in which XHTML 1.0 could be used in conjunction with the MathML Recommendation: The following example shows the way in which XHTML 1.0 markup could be incorporated into another XML namespace: A conforming user agent must meet all of the following criteria: White space is handled according to the following rules. The following characters are defined in [XML] white space characters: The XML processor normalizes different systems' line end codes into one single LINE FEED character, that is passed up to the application. This section is informative. Although overlapping is illegal in SGML, it is widely tolerated in existing browsers. CORRECT: nested elements. &lt;p&gt;here is an emphasized &lt;em&gt;paragraph&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; INCORRECT: overlapping elements &lt;p&gt;here is an emphasized &lt;em&gt;paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt; XHTML documents must use lower case for all HTML element and attribute names. This difference is necessary because XML is case-sensitive e.g. &lt;li&gt; and &lt;LI&gt; are different tags. CORRECT: terminated elements &lt;p&gt;here is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;here is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; INCORRECT: unterminated elements &lt;p&gt;here is a paragraph.&lt;p&gt;here is another paragraph.

SGML gives the writer of a DTD the ability to exclude specific elements from being contained within an element. Such prohibitions (called "exclusions") are not possible in XML. Note that in XHTML 1.0, the name attribute of these elements is formally deprecated, and will be removed in a subsequent version of XHTML. This section is normative. This appendix is normative. This appendix is normative. This appendix is informative. Avoid line breaks and multiple white space characters within attribute values. These are handled inconsistently by user agents. Don't include more than one isindex element in the document head. The isindex element is deprecated in favor of the input element. Use both the lang and xml:lang attributes when specifying the language of an element. The value of the xml:lang attribute takes precedence. This appendix is informative.

See "May". A value or behavior is unspecified, but it is not allowed to be used by Conforming Documents nor to be supported by Conforming User Agents. See "Must". Certain facilities in this specification are optional. If a facility is supported, it behaves as specified by this specification. An attribute is a parameter to an element declared in the DTD. An attribute's type and value range, including a possible default value, are defined in the DTD. See User Agent. A user agent is a system that processes XHTML documents in accordance with this specification. See User Agent Conformance for more information. must not contain other a elements. must not contain the img, object, big, small, sub, or sup elements. must not contain other label elements. must not contain other form elements. XHTML documents are XML conforming. As such, they are readily viewed, edited, and validated with standard XML tools. XHTML documents can be written to operate as well or better than they did before in existing HTML&#160;4-conforming user agents as well as in new, XHTML 1.0 conforming user agents. As the XHTML family evolves, documents conforming to XHTML 1.0 will be more likely to interoperate within and among various XHTML environments. If a user agent encounters an element it does not recognize, it must process the element's content. If a user agent encounters an attribute it does not recognize, it must ignore the entire attribute specification (i.e., the attribute and its value). If a user agent encounters an attribute value it does not recognize, it must use the default attribute value.

Map sequences of one or more white space characters (including line breaks) to a single inter-word space. CSS style sheets for XHTML should use lower case element and attribute names. Within the XHTML namespace, user agents are expected to recognize the "class" attribute. Therefore, style sheets should be able to continue using the shorthand "." selector syntax.

Many simple Web clients cannot display fonts other than monospace. Bi-directional text, bold faced font, and other text extension elements are not supported. It is recommended that style sheets be used to create a presentation that is appropriate for the device. Frames are not supported. Frames depend on a screen interface and may not be applicable to some small appliances like phones, pagers, and watches. This section is normative. This section is normative. XHTML Basic consists of the following XHTML modules: Note: (*) = This module is a required XHTML Host Language module. Finally, XHTML Basic adds the value attribute to the li element of the XHTML List Module. This section is normative. This section was originally a component of XForms 1.0, and was written by Martin Duerst. The inputmode Attribute Module defines the inputmode attribute. The following table shows additional attributes for elements defined elsewhere when the inputmode module is selected. Note: Additional guidelines for user agent implementation are found at [UAAG 1.0]. This is an example of a form for Japanese address input. Version 1.1 of this specification was produced by the W3C XHTML2 Working Group. At the time of publication, the members were: At publication of the second edition, the membership was: This appendix is normative. Finally, we define the new inputmode attribute module. This appendix is normative.

All sections of this document are normative unless noted as informative. This section is informative. Events are not applicable to static, printed versions of a document. Therefore, the Intrinsic Events module is not part of XHTML-Print. Frames are not supported. Frames depend on a screen interface and therefore are not applicable to printers. XHTML-Print consists of the following XHTML modules: Each attribute in the following sections is annotated with one of the following keywords indicating support options for a conforming printer: Note that the title attribute of the Core collection is not applicable to the printed page since there is no place to display such supplementary information. A printer MAY ignore the content of the title element since it is not part of the document's body. The src attribute of the input element is not supported since the image type is not part of basic forms. This module adds the style attribute to the Common attribute collection (section 3.1). within the JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) and EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) files. [Informative] In traditional Web-based applications of XHTML, image data is contained in a separate file on a Web server that the user agent retrieves. This section is informative.

This section is non-normative. This section is non-normative. This section is non-normative.  To illustrate, suppose we have the following set of facts: Host Languages that incorporate RDFa must adhere to the following:  The general syntax of a CURIE can be summarized as follows:   In RDFa these values are defined as follows: This section is non-normative. For example, the full IRI for Albert Einstein on DBPedia is: whilst to express the IRI above as a CURIE an author would do this: The author could also use a safe CURIE, as follows: would each generate the following triple: Consider the following example:  The processing rules are: This section is non-normative. This would generate the following triples: It is possible for the data to appear elsewhere in the document: which would still generate the triple: This should generate the following triples: Similarly, authors may make statements about images: which should generate the following triple: also creates the triple: the generated triples also include: This usage of “isolated” @typeof may be viewed as a shorthand for:  Similarly,  generates:  An RDFa Processor will generate the following triples:   An RDFa Processor will generate the following triples:  and second it is used to generate its own triple:  In this example there is one incomplete triple:  First the following incomplete triple is stored:  but processing dbp:dateOfBirth generates only one:  There are two types of object, IRI resources and literals.  Both of these examples give the following triple:  Literals can be given a data type using @datatype. This can be represented in RDFa as follows: which then yields two triples: yielding: Resulting in: which results in the following output graph: After vocabulary expansion, the output graph contains: This section is non-normative. Vocabulary expansion is then performed as follows: This section is non-normative. Specifically, the following datatypes are defined: This section is non-normative. This section is non-normative. which defines a prefix for the FOAF IRI. This section is non-normative. This section is non-normative.

A slightly different handling of @typeof, making it better adapted to practical usage. The document MUST be well-formed as defined in [XML10-4e].  There is no default vocabulary IRI. Syntax attributes: @prefix, @vocab. Subject attributes: @about. Predicate attributes: @property, @rel, @rev. Resource attributes: @resource, @href, @src. Literal attributes: @datatype, @content, @xml:lang or @lang. Macro attributes: @typeof, @inlist. a set of mappings from prefixes to IRIs; a mapping to use with the default prefix (for example, :p); a mapping to use when there is no prefix (for example, p); A list mapping that associates IRIs with lists. An initially empty language value. A recurse flag. Processing generally continues recursively through the entire tree of elements available. However,      if an author indicates that some branch of the tree should be treated as an XML literal, no further processing should      take place on that branch, and setting this flag to false would have that effect.      The local list mapping, mapping IRIs to lists If the value is a valid CURIE, then the resulting IRI is used. If the value is an absolute IRI, that value is used. Otherwise, the value is ignored. @vocab supports an IRI. the parent object is set to null; the list of incomplete triples is empty; the list mapping is empty; the language is set to null. the recurse flag is set to 'true'; the skip element flag is set to 'false'; new subject is set to null; current object resource is set to null; typed resource is set to null; A rdfa:Warning MUST be generated when a Term fails to be resolved. rdf:type rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:subPropertyOf owl:equivalentClass References to the other RDFa 1.1 documents, as well as to RDF 1.1 documents, have been updated A minor clarification has been added to section 4.1. to the processors can return processor and output graphs DO NOT use the @vocab feature.

The IANA registration for application/xhtml+xml was accepted during PR, leading to a small update to the corresponding section. "Parsed URL" has been given a proper mapping to the URL specification Improved the informative summary for several elements. (Mostly pointers to tag omission and ARIA rules.) Updated a few references to documents that have seen new revisions (RFC4281, RFC2313, RFC3490, MPEG-DASH) and provided a more stable link to BECSS. Added a note about and made some modifications to the URL reference.

The Protocols and Formats Working Group is no longer chartered to operate. Its work will continue in two new Working Groups: Resources from the PFWG remain available to support long-term institutional memory, but this information is of historical value only. The PFWG holds face-to-face meetings in various locations as needed. Information about upcoming and past meetings is in the PFWG Meetings page. In the past, PFWG meetings were held in W3C Member space; information about those meetings is available in the PFWG Group Meetings page. WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. The work has been divided into a series of modules and related documents.  The current editor's working drafts of these are:  Formal Public Working Drafts of these documents can be found from the WAI-ARIA Overview Page.  Editors' sources for the above specifications are maintained in the W3C ARIA GitHub repository. GitHub users can watch this repository and send pull requests. Media Accessibility User Requiremenst (public editors' draft) aggregates the requirements of an accessibility user that the W3C HTML5 Accessibility Task Force has collected with respect to audio and video on the Web. See also the Public Working Draft of Media Accessibility User Requirements. Editors' sources for the above specification is maintained in the W3C PFWG GitHub repository. GitHub users can watch this repository and send pull requests.  WAI-ARIA 1.0 has been completed. The work has been divided into five documents.  The following documents are W3C Recommendations: The following documents were developed for WAI-ARIA 1.0 but have not been, and are not expected to be, finalized. Role Attribute 1.0 is a W3C Recommendation. The Role Attribute allows the author to annotate markup languages with machine-extractable semantic information about the purpose of an element. Use cases include accessibility, device adaptation, server-side processing, and complex data description. This attribute can be integrated into any markup language. The role attribute is necessary to support WAI-ARIA to define roles in XML-based languages, when the languages do not define their own role attribute.   In addition to the work underway above, the PFWG has been responsible in the past for the incorporation of a number of the accessibility improvements introduced into W3C formats from HTML 4.0 onward including CSS, SMIL, SVG and VoiceXML. Some specific publications developed in service of this work:  Work of the PFWG is in accordance with the W3C Process. PFWG work is funded in part by the WAI Core project. The work of this group does not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the funder. The charter of the working group outlines the goals, work methods, and requirements for participation. It also explains why the working drafts and email archives of this group are in the members-only area. This activity is conducted by the W3C as part of its Web Accessibility Initiative W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a patent.

Other Accessibility API Mappings specifications depend on and extend this Core specification for specific technologies, including native techology features and WAI-ARIA extensions. See also the Public Working Draft of the Core Accessibility API Mappings. Describes how user agents determine names and descriptions of accessible objects from web content languages and expose them in accessibility APIs. See also the Public Working Draft of the Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.1.  This document describes how user agents map HTML5.1 [[!HTML51]] elements and attributes to platform accessibility API roles, states and properties on a variety of platforms, based on the Core Accessibility API Mappings [[!CORE-AAM]] specification for user agents. This document is designed to leverage these core mappings for the HTML5.1 host language.

Provides recommended approaches to create accessible Web content using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible. Also describes considerations that might not be evident to most implementors from the WAI-ARIA specification alone.  This paper evaluates the accessibility problems with CAPTCHA, a visual verification system popular on many Web sites, and evaluates a number of more-accessible alternatives to the same problems CAPTCHA claims to solve. This paper suggests a possible implementation of a language annotation system to clarify meaning in potentially ambiguous terms. The discussions for XAG take place on the public wai-xtech list.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats. You may read more in the press release.    W3C plans to update its site privacy policy shortly after 14 April. No material changes are intended in the new privacy policy.

XML&#8482; is the shorthand name for Extensible Markup Language [XML]. While retaining these beneficial features, XML removes many of the more complex features of SGML that make the authoring and design of suitable software both difficult and costly. The benefits of migrating to XHTML 1.0 are described above. Some of the benefits of migrating to XHTML in general are: This section is normative. This section is normative. A Strictly Conforming XHTML Document is an XML document that requires only the facilities described as mandatory in this specification. Such a document must meet all of the following criteria: It must conform to the constraints expressed in one of the three DTDs found in DTDs and in Appendix B. The root element of the document must be html. The DTD subset must not be used to override any parameter entities in the DTD. The following example shows the way in which XHTML 1.0 could be used in conjunction with the MathML Recommendation: The following example shows the way in which XHTML 1.0 markup could be incorporated into another XML namespace: A conforming user agent must meet all of the following criteria: White space is handled according to the following rules. The following characters are defined in [XML] white space characters: The XML processor normalizes different systems' line end codes into one single LINE FEED character, that is passed up to the application. This section is informative. Although overlapping is illegal in SGML, it is widely tolerated in existing browsers. CORRECT: nested elements. &lt;p&gt;here is an emphasized &lt;em&gt;paragraph&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; INCORRECT: overlapping elements &lt;p&gt;here is an emphasized &lt;em&gt;paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt; XHTML documents must use lower case for all HTML element and attribute names. This difference is necessary because XML is case-sensitive e.g. &lt;li&gt; and &lt;LI&gt; are different tags. CORRECT: terminated elements &lt;p&gt;here is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;here is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; INCORRECT: unterminated elements &lt;p&gt;here is a paragraph.&lt;p&gt;here is another paragraph.

SGML gives the writer of a DTD the ability to exclude specific elements from being contained within an element. Such prohibitions (called "exclusions") are not possible in XML. Note that in XHTML 1.0, the name attribute of these elements is formally deprecated, and will be removed in a subsequent version of XHTML. This section is normative. This appendix is normative. This appendix is normative. This appendix is informative. Avoid line breaks and multiple white space characters within attribute values. These are handled inconsistently by user agents. Don't include more than one isindex element in the document head. The isindex element is deprecated in favor of the input element. Use both the lang and xml:lang attributes when specifying the language of an element. The value of the xml:lang attribute takes precedence. This appendix is informative.

See User Agent Conformance for more information. must not contain other a elements. must not contain the img, object, big, small, sub, or sup elements. must not contain other label elements. must not contain other form elements. XHTML documents are XML conforming. As such, they are readily viewed, edited, and validated with standard XML tools. XHTML documents can be written to operate as well or better than they did before in existing HTML&#160;4-conforming user agents as well as in new, XHTML 1.0 conforming user agents. As the XHTML family evolves, documents conforming to XHTML 1.0 will be more likely to interoperate within and among various XHTML environments. If a user agent encounters an element it does not recognize, it must process the element's content. If a user agent encounters an attribute it does not recognize, it must ignore the entire attribute specification (i.e., the attribute and its value). If a user agent encounters an attribute value it does not recognize, it must use the default attribute value.

Map sequences of one or more white space characters (including line breaks) to a single inter-word space. CSS style sheets for XHTML should use lower case element and attribute names. Within the XHTML namespace, user agents are expected to recognize the "class" attribute. Therefore, style sheets should be able to continue using the shorthand "." selector syntax.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats.

À l'occasion de cet événement scientifique emblématique, découvrez ces travaux de chercheurs Inria qui&nbsp;aident à mieux comprendre et parfois, à mieux faire fonctionner cet organe fascinant. Les chercheurs Inria contribuent à l'étude du fonctionnement de notre système nerveux, les moyens de le soigner, d’interagir avec lui, et contribuent également au travail de modélisation.&nbsp; Le prochain séminaire IST Inria aura lieu du 18 au 22 septembre 2016. Organisé depuis plus de 30 ans, ce rendez-vous interroge les professionnels de l'information sur les problématiques émergentes. Thierry Mandon, le secrétaire d’Etat auprès de la Ministre de l’Education Nationale, de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche, chargé de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche, a inauguré le jeudi 10 les nouveaux locaux d’Inria à Paris dans le XIIe arrondissement. L’occasion pour les chercheurs de présenter leurs travaux les plus innovants (le centre de recherche de Rocquencourt est officiellement devenu le Centre Inria de Paris). Inria et la CNIL viennent de lancer un prix européen pour récompenser des articles scientifiques sur le sujet de la protection des données personnelles et de la vie privée. S’inscrivant dans le cadre de la convention de partenariat signée par Inria et la CNIL en 2011, le prix sera l’occasion de mettre en lumière les travaux de recherche dans le domaine de la protection des données. Il permet de sensibiliser l’ensemble de la communauté scientifique à la nécessité de développer des projets de recherche en lien avec ces thématiques. Mathématicien de premier plan, Benoît Perthame est une personnalité clé de la communauté scientifique internationale. Spécialiste des équations cinétiques, il est un pionnier, depuis les années 2000, du domaine des « maths bio ». Sa modélisation mathématique de la théorie de l'évolution de Darwin, ses études sur le cancer ou l’organisation de communauté cellulaires illustrent sa capacité à inventer de nouveaux concepts et à développer des outils d'analyse appliqués aux sciences du vivant. Spécialiste des protocoles de sécurité, Véronique Cortier imagine aujourd'hui les solutions qui permettront demain de sécuriser notre vie numérique. Elle développe notamment un système de vote électronique open source, appelé Belenios. Son credo : faire confiance à son ordinateur est globalement une mauvaise idée… Utiliser la statistique comme un outil moderne pour mieux aborder les grands enjeux de santé de notre époque : voilà le défi que s'est lancé Marc Lavielle. En conciliant des travaux scientifiques de premier plan et une capacité unique à s’appuyer sur des partenariats industriels, il a réussi à mettre au point une solution innovante, bénéficiant aujourd’hui à toute l’industrie pharmaceutique. Nous avons le regret devoir reporter cette première rencontre Inria-Cispa sur la cybersécurité. En effet, la grève SNCF annoncée pour ce jour menaçait de perturber fortement la tenue de la manifestation. Cette rencontre sera reportée à la rentrée 2016. Nous vous remercions par avance pour votre compréhension. Inria est à l’origine d’une importante production de logiciels. Ci-dessous quelques exemples de&nbsp;logiciels phares classés par secteur. Les partenariats stratégiques que met en place Inria sont des partenariats bilatéraux et de long terme avec de grands groupes industriels, formalisés dans un contrat-cadre. Un programme de recherche est élaboré conjointement pour Inria et son partenaire, sur la base des thématiques prioritaires proposées par l’industriel. Des projets de recherche, s'inscrivant dans ce programme, sont ensuite construits conjointement par les équipes d'Inria et du partenaire. De plus, un comité de pilotage et un comité scientifique garantissent la cohérence et la bonne marche de la collaboration. 1984 : Inria devient actionnaire d’une première société, SIMULOG. C’est le début d’une histoire de création d’entreprises toujours en marche ! Dès aujourd’hui et dans les mois qui viennent, Inria donne un coup de projecteur sur ses 30 ans de belles aventures entrepreneuriales. L’occasion de rappeler que, dans sa recherche d’impact économique et sociétal, la création d’entreprises est une des voies qu’Inria a décidé de privilégier.

The previous errata for this document, are also available. See also translations. This document is also available in these non-normative formats: XML and XHTML with color-coded revision indicators. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. The design goals for XML are: XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet. XML shall support a wide variety of applications. XML shall be compatible with SGML. It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents. XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear. The XML design should be prepared quickly. The design of XML shall be formal and concise. XML documents shall be easy to create. Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance. Taken as a whole, it matches the production labeled document. It meets all the well-formedness constraints given in this specification. Matching the document production implies that: It contains one or more elements. This section defines some symbols used widely in the grammar. [Definition: A Name is an Nmtoken with a restricted set of initial characters.]  Disallowed initial characters for Names include digits, diacritics, the full stop and the hyphen. An example of a comment: and so is this: The external subset, if any, MUST match the production for extSubset. An example of an XML document with a document type declaration: The declarations can also be given locally, as in this example: An example XML declaration with a standalone document declaration: (Productions 33 through 38 have been removed.) For example: A simple declaration for xml:lang might take the form An example of a start-tag: An example of an end-tag: Examples of empty elements: where the Name gives the element type being declared. An element type MUST NOT be declared more than once. Examples of element type declarations: Examples of element-content models: Examples of mixed content declarations: To define the set of attributes pertaining to a given element type. To establish type constraints for these attributes. An element type MUST NOT have more than one ID attribute specified. Examples of attribute-list declarations: Begin with a normalized value consisting of the empty string. For another character, append the character to the normalized value. An example: A parsed entity MUST NOT contain a recursive reference to itself, either directly or indirectly. Examples of character and entity references: Example of a parameter-entity reference: An internal entity is a parsed entity. Example of an internal entity declaration: If the NDataDecl is present, this is a general unparsed entity; otherwise it is a parsed entity. The original character is replaced by the resulting character sequence. Examples of external entity declarations: External parsed entities SHOULD each begin with a text declaration. Only parsed entities that are referenced directly or indirectly within the document are required to be well-formed. Examples of text declarations containing encoding declarations: . a reference to an external entity in an attribute value. while this is not: matches any Char with a value in the range(s) indicated (inclusive). matches A or nothing; optional A. matches A or B. matches any string that matches A but does not match B.  Other notations used in the productions are:  comment. well-formedness constraint; this identifies by name a constraint on well-formed documents associated with a production. Characters ':' and '_' are allowed as name-start characters. Characters '-' and '.' are allowed as name characters. If the DTD contains the declaration This produces the following: In the following example If the definition of x had been With a Byte Order Mark: Without a Byte Order Mark: Variation selector characters should not be used in names.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats.

This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. The design goals for XML are: XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet. XML shall support a wide variety of applications. XML shall be compatible with SGML. It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents. XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear. The XML design should be prepared quickly. The design of XML shall be formal and concise. XML documents shall be easy to create. Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance. Taken as a whole, it matches the production labeled document. It meets all the well-formedness constraints given in this specification. Matching the document production implies that: It contains one or more elements. This section defines some symbols used widely in the grammar. [Definition: A Name is an Nmtoken with a restricted set of initial characters.]  Disallowed initial characters for Names include digits, diacritics, the full stop and the hyphen. An example of a comment: and so is this: The external subset, if any, MUST match the production for extSubset. An example of an XML document with a document type declaration: The declarations can also be given locally, as in this example: An example XML declaration with a standalone document declaration: (Productions 33 through 38 have been removed.) For example: A simple declaration for xml:lang might take the form An example of a start-tag: An example of an end-tag: Examples of empty elements: where the Name gives the element type being declared. An element type MUST NOT be declared more than once. Examples of element type declarations: Examples of element-content models: Examples of mixed content declarations: To define the set of attributes pertaining to a given element type. To establish type constraints for these attributes. An element type MUST NOT have more than one ID attribute specified. Examples of attribute-list declarations: Begin with a normalized value consisting of the empty string. For another character, append the character to the normalized value. An example: A parsed entity MUST NOT contain a recursive reference to itself, either directly or indirectly. Examples of character and entity references: Example of a parameter-entity reference: An internal entity is a parsed entity. Example of an internal entity declaration: If the NDataDecl is present, this is a general unparsed entity; otherwise it is a parsed entity. The original character is replaced by the resulting character sequence. Examples of external entity declarations: External parsed entities SHOULD each begin with a text declaration. Only parsed entities that are referenced directly or indirectly within the document are required to be well-formed. Examples of text declarations containing encoding declarations: . a reference to an external entity in an attribute value. while this is not: matches any Char with a value in the range(s) indicated (inclusive). matches A or nothing; optional A. matches A or B. matches any string that matches A but does not match B.  Other notations used in the productions are:  comment. well-formedness constraint; this identifies by name a constraint on well-formed documents associated with a production. Characters ':' and '_' are allowed as name-start characters. Characters '-' and '.' are allowed as name characters. If the DTD contains the declaration This produces the following: In the following example If the definition of x had been With a Byte Order Mark: Without a Byte Order Mark: Variation selector characters should not be used in names.

This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. The design goals for XML are: XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet. XML shall support a wide variety of applications. XML shall be compatible with SGML. It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents. XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear. The XML design should be prepared quickly. The design of XML shall be formal and concise. XML documents shall be easy to create. Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance. Taken as a whole, it matches the production labeled document. It meets all the well-formedness constraints given in this specification. Matching the document production implies that: It contains one or more elements. This section defines some symbols used widely in the grammar. [Definition: A Name is an Nmtoken with a restricted set of initial characters.]  Disallowed initial characters for Names include digits, diacritics, the full stop and the hyphen. An example of a comment: and so is this: The external subset, if any, MUST match the production for extSubset. An example of an XML document with a document type declaration: The declarations can also be given locally, as in this example: An example XML declaration with a standalone document declaration: (Productions 33 through 38 have been removed.) For example: A simple declaration for xml:lang might take the form An example of a start-tag: An example of an end-tag: Examples of empty elements: where the Name gives the element type being declared. An element type MUST NOT be declared more than once. Examples of element type declarations: Examples of element-content models: Examples of mixed content declarations: To define the set of attributes pertaining to a given element type. To establish type constraints for these attributes. An element type MUST NOT have more than one ID attribute specified. Examples of attribute-list declarations: Begin with a normalized value consisting of the empty string. For another character, append the character to the normalized value. An example: A parsed entity MUST NOT contain a recursive reference to itself, either directly or indirectly. Examples of character and entity references: Example of a parameter-entity reference: An internal entity is a parsed entity. Example of an internal entity declaration: If the NDataDecl is present, this is a general unparsed entity; otherwise it is a parsed entity. The original character is replaced by the resulting character sequence. Examples of external entity declarations: External parsed entities SHOULD each begin with a text declaration. Only parsed entities that are referenced directly or indirectly within the document are required to be well-formed. Examples of text declarations containing encoding declarations: . a reference to an external entity in an attribute value. while this is not: matches any Char with a value in the range(s) indicated (inclusive). matches A or nothing; optional A. matches A or B. matches any string that matches A but does not match B.  Other notations used in the productions are:  comment. well-formedness constraint; this identifies by name a constraint on well-formed documents associated with a production.

This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. The design goals for XML are: XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet. XML shall support a wide variety of applications. XML shall be compatible with SGML. It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents. XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear. The XML design should be prepared quickly. The design of XML shall be formal and concise. XML documents shall be easy to create. Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance. Taken as a whole, it matches the production labeled document. It meets all the well-formedness constraints given in this specification. Matching the document production implies that: It contains one or more elements. This section defines some symbols used widely in the grammar. [Definition: A Name is an Nmtoken with a restricted set of initial characters.]  Disallowed initial characters for Names include digits, diacritics, the full stop and the hyphen. An example of a comment: and so is this: The external subset, if any, MUST match the production for extSubset. An example of an XML document with a document type declaration: The declarations can also be given locally, as in this example: An example XML declaration with a standalone document declaration: (Productions 33 through 38 have been removed.) For example: A simple declaration for xml:lang might take the form An example of a start-tag: An example of an end-tag: Examples of empty elements: where the Name gives the element type being declared. An element type MUST NOT be declared more than once. Examples of element type declarations: Examples of element-content models: Examples of mixed content declarations: To define the set of attributes pertaining to a given element type. To establish type constraints for these attributes. An element type MUST NOT have more than one ID attribute specified. Examples of attribute-list declarations: Begin with a normalized value consisting of the empty string. For another character, append the character to the normalized value. An example: A parsed entity MUST NOT contain a recursive reference to itself, either directly or indirectly. Examples of character and entity references: Example of a parameter-entity reference: An internal entity is a parsed entity. Example of an internal entity declaration: If the NDataDecl is present, this is a general unparsed entity; otherwise it is a parsed entity. The original character is replaced by the resulting character sequence. Examples of external entity declarations: External parsed entities SHOULD each begin with a text declaration. Only parsed entities that are referenced directly or indirectly within the document are required to be well-formed. Examples of text declarations containing encoding declarations: . a reference to an external entity in an attribute value. while this is not: matches any Char with a value in the range(s) indicated (inclusive). matches A or nothing; optional A. matches A or B. matches any string that matches A but does not match B.  Other notations used in the productions are:  comment. well-formedness constraint; this identifies by name a constraint on well-formed documents associated with a production. Characters ':' and '_' are allowed as name-start characters. Characters '-' and '.' are allowed as name characters. If the DTD contains the declaration This produces the following: In the following example If the definition of x had been With a Byte Order Mark: Without a Byte Order Mark: Variation selector characters should not be used in names.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats.

XHTML 1.0 - the first baby step toward a well-formed, valid web.  At its inception, we were all convinced that XML would rule the world, and HTML needed to be based upon XML if it was to survive.  We were a little bit wrong. XHTML Media Types - a Note that explained how to deliver the new XHTML documents to legacy user agents.  Still relevant and widely used today.  We have a small update for it that might still get published - you can see it here. XHTML Modularization - a set of building blocks and rules that language designers could use.  M12N is the basis for many activities within and outside of the W3C.  It continues to be used all over the place.  It started out being used only for XML DTDs, but was expanded to XML Schema (finally published recently, but complete for many years).  In the next weeks we will release a final installment of this, XHTML Modularization for RelaxNG. XML Events - a declarative way to define events and bind them to elements and observers.  It's first version was published by the XHTML activity.  It has now been taken over by the XForms activity.  I hope that they will get XML Events 2 out the door at some point. XHTML 1.1 - a tight, XML-centric version of XHTML based upon XHTML Modularization.  We published an update to this last week, but it is a stable grammar that can be used anywhere.  It is also the basis for many extended XHTML Grammars.  The update last week makes it possible to validate using XML Schema, and also to use the 'lang' attribute to improve use of XHTML 1.1 documents by assistive technologies. XHTML Basic - a version of XHTML targeted at the mobile community. XHTML Print - a version of XHTML targeted at rendering consistently on printers. XForms - an independent activity, but one that started within the XHTML activity. XHTML+RDFa - another independent activity.  Originally a joint task force of the XHTML2 and Semantic Web working groups.  The latest version builds up this early work, but continues to take advantage of XHTML Modularization for its definitions. CURIEs - a compact expression syntax for URIs.  Used by RDFa, but also potentially by other specifications that need to readily reference resources without using long URIs in attributes. The Role Attribute module - an independent module to add a role attribute.  Useful for accessibility, but also for general semantic notation.  This work has been taken on by the Protocols and Formats Working Group. The Access module - an independent module to add an access element.  This element would allow binding of 'keys' and events to elements.  The original module has no owner, but the general work has been picked up by the Protocols and Formats Working Group. XHTML 2 - a sweeping revision of XHTML.  This work was never completed, but will be published in its current state as a Note. XHTML Modularization 2.0 - an update to the modularization framework to accompany XHTML 2. XFrames - an improvement on traditional HTML framesets. XHTML 1.2 - a version of XHTML that added the role attribute, the access element, RDFa, and ARIA.  This was never a formal deliverable, but was a logical extension of the work. RDFa is (still) the best way to improve your SEO Xyzzy.  Nothing Happens.

In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats.

Early examples include the Oracle Exadata Database Machine X2-8, and the first Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud, both introduced in late 2010. During 2011, Oracle introduced the SPARC SuperCluster  T4-4, a general-purpose, engineered system with Oracle Solaris that delivered record-breaking performance on a series of enterprise benchmarks. Oracle's SPARC-based systems are some of the most scalable, reliable, and secure products available today. Sun's prized software portfolio has continued to develop as well, with new releases of Oracle Solaris, MySQL, and the recent introduction of Java 7.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats. You may read more in the press release.    W3C plans to update its site privacy policy shortly after 14 April. No material changes are intended in the new privacy policy. Here No open positions at this time. Check out our short video on Web standards! Syncro Soft encourages the adoption of the W3C standards.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats.

Yes, I forgot that I had this blog I should be updating.  My bad!  P.P.S.  Hooray for the Oxford Comma! Blog Archive About Me General information on RDFa at&nbsp;http://rdfa.info/ The RDFa Primer An interactive checker at&nbsp;http://rdfa.info/play/ Google's checker at&nbsp;http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets Help for creating licenses at&nbsp;http://creativecommons.org/choose/ Information on vocabularies at&nbsp;http://www.schema.org/ HTML 4.01 - last updated in 1999, but still the basis of most of the web. XHTML 1.0 - the first baby step toward a well-formed, valid web.  At its inception, we were all convinced that XML would rule the world, and HTML needed to be based upon XML if it was to survive.  We were a little bit wrong. XHTML Media Types - a Note that explained how to deliver the new XHTML documents to legacy user agents.  Still relevant and widely used today.  We have a small update for it that might still get published - you can see it here. XHTML Modularization - a set of building blocks and rules that language designers could use.  M12N is the basis for many activities within and outside of the W3C.  It continues to be used all over the place.  It started out being used only for XML DTDs, but was expanded to XML Schema (finally published recently, but complete for many years).  In the next weeks we will release a final installment of this, XHTML Modularization for RelaxNG. XML Events - a declarative way to define events and bind them to elements and observers.  It's first version was published by the XHTML activity.  It has now been taken over by the XForms activity.  I hope that they will get XML Events 2 out the door at some point. XHTML 1.1 - a tight, XML-centric version of XHTML based upon XHTML Modularization.  We published an update to this last week, but it is a stable grammar that can be used anywhere.  It is also the basis for many extended XHTML Grammars.  The update last week makes it possible to validate using XML Schema, and also to use the 'lang' attribute to improve use of XHTML 1.1 documents by assistive technologies. XHTML Basic - a version of XHTML targeted at the mobile community. XHTML Print - a version of XHTML targeted at rendering consistently on printers. XForms - an independent activity, but one that started within the XHTML activity. XHTML+RDFa - another independent activity.  Originally a joint task force of the XHTML2 and Semantic Web working groups.  The latest version builds up this early work, but continues to take advantage of XHTML Modularization for its definitions. CURIEs - a compact expression syntax for URIs.  Used by RDFa, but also potentially by other specifications that need to readily reference resources without using long URIs in attributes. The Role Attribute module - an independent module to add a role attribute.  Useful for accessibility, but also for general semantic notation.  This work has been taken on by the Protocols and Formats Working Group. The Access module - an independent module to add an access element.  This element would allow binding of 'keys' and events to elements.  The original module has no owner, but the general work has been picked up by the Protocols and Formats Working Group. XHTML 2 - a sweeping revision of XHTML.  This work was never completed, but will be published in its current state as a Note. XHTML Modularization 2.0 - an update to the modularization framework to accompany XHTML 2. XFrames - an improvement on traditional HTML framesets. XHTML 1.2 - a version of XHTML that added the role attribute, the access element, RDFa, and ARIA.  This was never a formal deliverable, but was a logical extension of the work. RDFa is (still) the best way to improve your SEO Xyzzy.  Nothing Happens.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats. You may read more in the press release.    W3C plans to update its site privacy policy shortly after 14 April. No material changes are intended in the new privacy policy.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats. You may read more in the press release.    W3C plans to update its site privacy policy shortly after 14 April. No material changes are intended in the new privacy policy. Here No open positions at this time. Check out our short video on Web standards! CBCL advocate the adoption of the W3C standards.

Wednesday, July 17, 2013 Thursday, July 12, 2012 Tuesday, January 31, 2012 Wednesday, January 4, 2012 Thursday, December 22, 2011 Friday, December 17, 2010 Sunday, November 28, 2010  P.S. Yes, I forgot that I had this blog I should be updating.  My bad!  P.P.S.  Hooray for the Oxford Comma! Blog Archive About Me General information on RDFa at&nbsp;http://rdfa.info/ The RDFa Primer An interactive checker at&nbsp;http://rdfa.info/play/ Google's checker at&nbsp;http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets Help for creating licenses at&nbsp;http://creativecommons.org/choose/ Information on vocabularies at&nbsp;http://www.schema.org/ HTML 4.01 - last updated in 1999, but still the basis of most of the web. XHTML 1.0 - the first baby step toward a well-formed, valid web.  At its inception, we were all convinced that XML would rule the world, and HTML needed to be based upon XML if it was to survive.  We were a little bit wrong. XHTML Media Types - a Note that explained how to deliver the new XHTML documents to legacy user agents.  Still relevant and widely used today.  We have a small update for it that might still get published - you can see it here. XHTML Modularization - a set of building blocks and rules that language designers could use.  M12N is the basis for many activities within and outside of the W3C.  It continues to be used all over the place.  It started out being used only for XML DTDs, but was expanded to XML Schema (finally published recently, but complete for many years).  In the next weeks we will release a final installment of this, XHTML Modularization for RelaxNG. XML Events - a declarative way to define events and bind them to elements and observers.  It's first version was published by the XHTML activity.  It has now been taken over by the XForms activity.  I hope that they will get XML Events 2 out the door at some point. XHTML 1.1 - a tight, XML-centric version of XHTML based upon XHTML Modularization.  We published an update to this last week, but it is a stable grammar that can be used anywhere.  It is also the basis for many extended XHTML Grammars.  The update last week makes it possible to validate using XML Schema, and also to use the 'lang' attribute to improve use of XHTML 1.1 documents by assistive technologies. XHTML Basic - a version of XHTML targeted at the mobile community. XHTML Print - a version of XHTML targeted at rendering consistently on printers. XForms - an independent activity, but one that started within the XHTML activity. XHTML+RDFa - another independent activity.  Originally a joint task force of the XHTML2 and Semantic Web working groups.  The latest version builds up this early work, but continues to take advantage of XHTML Modularization for its definitions. CURIEs - a compact expression syntax for URIs.  Used by RDFa, but also potentially by other specifications that need to readily reference resources without using long URIs in attributes. The Role Attribute module - an independent module to add a role attribute.  Useful for accessibility, but also for general semantic notation.  This work has been taken on by the Protocols and Formats Working Group. The Access module - an independent module to add an access element.  This element would allow binding of 'keys' and events to elements.  The original module has no owner, but the general work has been picked up by the Protocols and Formats Working Group. XHTML 2 - a sweeping revision of XHTML.  This work was never completed, but will be published in its current state as a Note. XHTML Modularization 2.0 - an update to the modularization framework to accompany XHTML 2. XFrames - an improvement on traditional HTML framesets. XHTML 1.2 - a version of XHTML that added the role attribute, the access element, RDFa, and ARIA.  This was never a formal deliverable, but was a logical extension of the work. RDFa is (still) the best way to improve your SEO Xyzzy.  Nothing Happens.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats. You may read more in the press release.    W3C plans to update its site privacy policy shortly after 14 April. No material changes are intended in the new privacy policy. Here No open positions at this time. Check out our short video on Web standards! CBCL advocate the adoption of the W3C standards.

Contents Contents This section is normative. Except when overridden in this document, the semantics of these elements and attributes are defined in [HTML4]. The following basic attribute sets are used on many elements. In each case where they are used, their use is identified via their collection name rather than enumerating the list. Note that the Events collection is only defined when the Intrinsic Events Module is selected. Otherwise, the Events collection is empty. Also note that the Style collection is only defined when the Style Attribute Module is selected. Otherwise, the Style collection is empty. Finally, note that the I18N collection only contains the xml:lang attribute unless the Bi-directional Text Module module is selected. The core modules are modules that are required to be present in any XHTML Family Conforming Document Type. This module is the basic structural definition for XHTML content.

Contents Contents This section is normative. Except when overridden in this document, the semantics of these elements and attributes are defined in [HTML4]. The following basic attribute sets are used on many elements. In each case where they are used, their use is identified via their collection name rather than enumerating the list. Note that the Events collection is only defined when the Intrinsic Events Module is selected. Otherwise, the Events collection is empty. Also note that the Style collection is only defined when the Style Attribute Module is selected. Otherwise, the Style collection is empty. Finally, note that the I18N collection only contains the xml:lang attribute unless the Bi-directional Text Module module is selected. The core modules are modules that are required to be present in any XHTML Family Conforming Document Type. This module is the basic structural definition for XHTML content. The html element acts as the root element for all XHTML Family Document Types.

The Basic Forms Module is a subset of the Forms Module. These modules may not be used together in a single document type. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema The Forms Module provides all of the forms features found in HTML 4.0. Specifically, the Forms Module supports: This module defines two content sets: When this module is used, it adds the Form content set to the Block content set and it adds the Formctrl content set to the Inline content set as these are defined in the Text Module. The Forms Module is a superset of the Basic Forms Module. These modules may not be used together in a single document type. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema The Basic Tables Module provides table-related elements, but only in a limited form.

/+/ normative Contents Contents This section is normative. This specification defines a method for defining XHTML-conforming modules. A module conforms to this specification when it meets all of the following criteria: A conforming user agent must meet all of the following criteria (as defined in [XHTML1]): The document type MUST be defined using one of the implementation methods defined by the W3C. Currently this is limited to XML DTDs and XML Schema. The schema which defines the document type must include, at a minimum, the Structure, Hypertext, Text, and List modules defined in this specification. The document type MUST be defined using one of the implementation methods defined by the W3C. Currently this is limited to XML DTDs and XML Schemas. The schema which defines the document type MUST include, at a minimum, the Hypertext, Text, and List modules defined in this specification. The document type MUST be defined using one of the implementation methods defined by the W3C. Currently this is limited to XML DTDs and XML Schemas. The schema that defines the module MUST have a unique identifier as defined in Naming Rules. When the module is defined using an XML DTD, the module MUST isolate its parameter entity names through the use of unique prefixes or other, similar methods. If a user agent encounters an element it does not recognize, it MUST continue to process the children of that element. If a user agent encounters an attribute it does not recognize, it MUST ignore the entire attribute specification (i.e., the attribute and its value). The leading field must be "-" to indicate a privately defined resource. The fourth field defines the language in which the item is developed (e.g., EN).

W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. The design goals for XML are: XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet. XML shall support a wide variety of applications. XML shall be compatible with SGML. It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents. XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear. The XML design should be prepared quickly. The design of XML shall be formal and concise. XML documents shall be easy to create. Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance. Taken as a whole, it matches the production labeled document. It meets all the well-formedness constraints given in this specification. Matching the document production implies that: It contains one or more elements. This section defines some symbols used widely in the grammar. An example of a comment: and so is this: The external subset, if any, MUST match the production for extSubset. An example of an XML document with a document type declaration: The declarations can also be given locally, as in this example: An example XML declaration with a standalone document declaration: (Productions 33 through 38 have been removed.) For example: A simple declaration for xml:lang might take the form An example of a start-tag: An example of an end-tag: Examples of empty elements: where the Name gives the element type being declared. An element type MUST NOT be declared more than once. Examples of element type declarations: Examples of element-content models: Examples of mixed content declarations: To define the set of attributes pertaining to a given element type. To establish type constraints for these attributes. An element type MUST NOT have more than one ID attribute specified. Examples of attribute-list declarations: Begin with a normalized value consisting of the empty string. For another character, append the character to the normalized value. An example: A parsed entity MUST NOT contain a recursive reference to itself, either directly or indirectly. Examples of character and entity references: Example of a parameter-entity reference: An internal entity is a parsed entity. Example of an internal entity declaration: If the NDataDecl is present, this is a general unparsed entity; otherwise it is a parsed entity. The original character is replaced by the resulting character sequence. Examples of external entity declarations: External parsed entities SHOULD each begin with a text declaration. Only parsed entities that are referenced directly or indirectly within the document are required to be well-formed. Examples of text declarations containing encoding declarations: . a reference to an external entity in an attribute value. while this is not: matches any Char with a value in the range(s) indicated (inclusive). matches A or nothing; optional A. matches A or B. matches any string that matches A but does not match B.  Other notations used in the productions are:  comment. well-formedness constraint; this identifies by name a constraint on well-formed documents associated with a production. Characters ':' and '_' are allowed as name-start characters. Characters '-' and '.' are allowed as name characters. If the DTD contains the declaration This produces the following: With a Byte Order Mark: Without a Byte Order Mark: Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fourth Edition) W3C Recommendation 16 August 2006, edited in place 29 September 2006 Abstract Status of this Document Table of Contents 1 Introduction 2 Documents 3 Logical Structures 4 Physical Structures 5 Conformance 6 Notation A References B Character Classes C XML and SGML (Non-Normative) D Expansion of Entity and Character References (Non-Normative) E Deterministic Content Models (Non-Normative) F Autodetection of Character Encodings (Non-Normative) G W3C XML Working Group (Non-Normative) H W3C XML Core Working Group (Non-Normative) I Production Notes (Non-Normative) Appendices 1.1 Origin and Goals 1.2 Terminology 2.1 Well-Formed XML Documents 2.2 Characters 2.3 Common Syntactic Constructs 2.4 Character Data and Markup 2.5 Comments 2.6 Processing Instructions 2.7 CDATA Sections 2.8 Prolog and Document Type Declaration 2.9 Standalone Document Declaration 2.10 White Space Handling 2.11 End-of-Line Handling 2.12 Language Identification 3.1 Start-Tags, End-Tags, and Empty-Element Tags 3.2 Element Type Declarations 3.3 Attribute-List Declarations 3.4 Conditional Sections 4.1 Character and Entity References 4.2 Entity Declarations 4.3 Parsed Entities 4.4 XML Processor Treatment of Entities and References 4.5 Construction of Entity Replacement Text 4.6 Predefined Entities 4.7 Notation Declarations 4.8 Document Entity 5.1 Validating and Non-Validating Processors 5.2 Using XML Processors A.1 Normative References A.2 Other References F.1 Detection Without External Encoding Information F.2 Priorities in the Presence of External Encoding Information 3.2.1 Element Content 3.2.2 Mixed Content 3.3.1 Attribute Types 3.3.2 Attribute Defaults 3.3.3 Attribute-Value Normalization 4.2.1 Internal Entities 4.2.2 External Entities 4.3.1 The Text Declaration 4.3.2 Well-Formed Parsed Entities 4.3.3 Character Encoding in Entities 4.4.1 Not Recognized 4.4.2 Included 4.4.3 Included If Validating 4.4.4 Forbidden 4.4.5 Included in Literal 4.4.6 Notify 4.4.7 Bypassed 4.4.8 Included as PE 4.4.9 Error Document Character Range White Space Names and Tokens Literals Character Data Comments Processing Instructions CDATA Sections Prolog Document Type Definition External Subset Standalone Document Declaration Element Start-tag End-tag Content of Elements Tags for Empty Elements Element Type Declaration Element-content Models Mixed-content Declaration Attribute-list Declaration Attribute Types Enumerated Attribute Types Attribute Defaults Conditional Section Character Reference Entity Reference Entity Declaration External Entity Declaration Text Declaration Well-Formed External Parsed Entity Encoding Declaration Notation Declarations Characters &lt;!-- declarations for &lt;head&gt; &amp; &lt;body&gt; --&gt; &lt;!-- B+, B, or B---&gt; &lt;![CDATA[&lt;greeting&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/greeting&gt;]]&gt;  &lt;greeting&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/greeting&gt; &lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone='yes'?&gt; xml:lang CDATA #IMPLIED &lt;termdef id="dt-dog" term="dog"&gt; &lt;/termdef&gt; x y z #x20 #x20 x y z a="&amp;d;&amp;d;A&amp;a;&amp;#x20;&amp;a;B&amp;da;" A #x20 B #x20 #x20 A #x20 #x20 #x20 B #x20 #x20 #xD #xD A #xA #xA B #xD #xA #xD #xD A #xA #xA B #xD #xA symbol ::= expression This version: Latest version: Previous version: Editors: Tim Bray, Textuality and Netscape &lt;tbray@textuality.com&gt; Jean Paoli, Microsoft &lt;jeanpa@microsoft.com&gt; C.

An implementation report is available at http://www.w3.org/XML/2006/06/xml10-4e-implementation.html. A Test Suite is maintained to help assessing conformance to this specification. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. The design goals for XML are: XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet. XML shall support a wide variety of applications. XML shall be compatible with SGML. It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents. XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear. The XML design should be prepared quickly. The design of XML shall be formal and concise. XML documents shall be easy to create. Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance. Taken as a whole, it matches the production labeled document. It meets all the well-formedness constraints given in this specification. Matching the document production implies that: It contains one or more elements. This section defines some symbols used widely in the grammar. An example of a comment: and so is this: The external subset, if any, MUST match the production for extSubset. An example of an XML document with a document type declaration: The declarations can also be given locally, as in this example: An example XML declaration with a standalone document declaration: (Productions 33 through 38 have been removed.) For example: A simple declaration for xml:lang might take the form An example of a start-tag: An example of an end-tag: Examples of empty elements: where the Name gives the element type being declared. An element type MUST NOT be declared more than once. Examples of element type declarations: Examples of element-content models: Examples of mixed content declarations: To define the set of attributes pertaining to a given element type. To establish type constraints for these attributes. An element type MUST NOT have more than one ID attribute specified. Examples of attribute-list declarations: Begin with a normalized value consisting of the empty string. For another character, append the character to the normalized value. An example: A parsed entity MUST NOT contain a recursive reference to itself, either directly or indirectly. Examples of character and entity references: Example of a parameter-entity reference: An internal entity is a parsed entity. Example of an internal entity declaration: If the NDataDecl is present, this is a general unparsed entity; otherwise it is a parsed entity. The original character is replaced by the resulting character sequence. Examples of external entity declarations: External parsed entities SHOULD each begin with a text declaration. Only parsed entities that are referenced directly or indirectly within the document are required to be well-formed. Examples of text declarations containing encoding declarations: . a reference to an external entity in an attribute value. while this is not: matches any Char with a value in the range(s) indicated (inclusive). matches A or nothing; optional A. matches A or B. matches any string that matches A but does not match B.  Other notations used in the productions are:  comment. well-formedness constraint; this identifies by name a constraint on well-formed documents associated with a production. Characters ':' and '_' are allowed as name-start characters. Characters '-' and '.' are allowed as name characters. If the DTD contains the declaration This produces the following: With a Byte Order Mark: Without a Byte Order Mark: Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fourth Edition) W3C Recommendation 16 August 2006, edited in place 29 September 2006 Abstract Status of this Document Table of Contents 1 Introduction 2 Documents 3 Logical Structures 4 Physical Structures 5 Conformance 6 Notation A References B Character Classes C XML and SGML (Non-Normative) D Expansion of Entity and Character References (Non-Normative) E Deterministic Content Models (Non-Normative) F Autodetection of Character Encodings (Non-Normative) G W3C XML Working Group (Non-Normative) H W3C XML Core Working Group (Non-Normative) I Production Notes (Non-Normative) Appendices 1.1 Origin and Goals 1.2 Terminology 2.1 Well-Formed XML Documents 2.2 Characters 2.3 Common Syntactic Constructs 2.4 Character Data and Markup 2.5 Comments 2.6 Processing Instructions 2.7 CDATA Sections 2.8 Prolog and Document Type Declaration 2.9 Standalone Document Declaration 2.10 White Space Handling 2.11 End-of-Line Handling 2.12 Language Identification 3.1 Start-Tags, End-Tags, and Empty-Element Tags 3.2 Element Type Declarations 3.3 Attribute-List Declarations 3.4 Conditional Sections 4.1 Character and Entity References 4.2 Entity Declarations 4.3 Parsed Entities 4.4 XML Processor Treatment of Entities and References 4.5 Construction of Entity Replacement Text 4.6 Predefined Entities 4.7 Notation Declarations 4.8 Document Entity 5.1 Validating and Non-Validating Processors 5.2 Using XML Processors A.1 Normative References A.2 Other References F.1 Detection Without External Encoding Information F.2 Priorities in the Presence of External Encoding Information 3.2.1 Element Content 3.2.2 Mixed Content 3.3.1 Attribute Types 3.3.2 Attribute Defaults 3.3.3 Attribute-Value Normalization 4.2.1 Internal Entities 4.2.2 External Entities 4.3.1 The Text Declaration 4.3.2 Well-Formed Parsed Entities 4.3.3 Character Encoding in Entities 4.4.1 Not Recognized 4.4.2 Included 4.4.3 Included If Validating 4.4.4 Forbidden 4.4.5 Included in Literal 4.4.6 Notify 4.4.7 Bypassed 4.4.8 Included as PE 4.4.9 Error Document Character Range White Space Names and Tokens Literals Character Data Comments Processing Instructions CDATA Sections Prolog Document Type Definition External Subset Standalone Document Declaration Element Start-tag End-tag Content of Elements Tags for Empty Elements Element Type Declaration Element-content Models Mixed-content Declaration Attribute-list Declaration Attribute Types Enumerated Attribute Types Attribute Defaults Conditional Section Character Reference Entity Reference Entity Declaration External Entity Declaration Text Declaration Well-Formed External Parsed Entity Encoding Declaration Notation Declarations Characters &lt;!-- declarations for &lt;head&gt; &amp; &lt;body&gt; --&gt; &lt;!-- B+, B, or B---&gt; &lt;![CDATA[&lt;greeting&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/greeting&gt;]]&gt;  &lt;greeting&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/greeting&gt; &lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone='yes'?&gt; xml:lang CDATA #IMPLIED &lt;termdef id="dt-dog" term="dog"&gt; &lt;/termdef&gt; x y z #x20 #x20 x y z a="&amp;d;&amp;d;A&amp;a;&amp;#x20;&amp;a;B&amp;da;" A #x20 B #x20 #x20 A #x20 #x20 #x20 B #x20 #x20 #xD #xD A #xA #xA B #xD #xA #xD #xD A #xA #xA B #xD #xA symbol ::= expression This version: Latest version: Previous version: Editors: Tim Bray, Textuality and Netscape &lt;tbray@textuality.com&gt; Jean Paoli, Microsoft &lt;jeanpa@microsoft.com&gt; C.

This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. The design goals for XML are: XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet. XML shall support a wide variety of applications. XML shall be compatible with SGML. It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents. XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear. The XML design should be prepared quickly. The design of XML shall be formal and concise. XML documents shall be easy to create. Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance. Taken as a whole, it matches the production labeled document. It meets all the well-formedness constraints given in this specification. Matching the document production implies that: It contains one or more elements. This section defines some symbols used widely in the grammar. [Definition: A Name is an Nmtoken with a restricted set of initial characters.]  Disallowed initial characters for Names include digits, diacritics, the full stop and the hyphen. An example of a comment: and so is this: The external subset, if any, MUST match the production for extSubset. An example of an XML document with a document type declaration: The declarations can also be given locally, as in this example: An example XML declaration with a standalone document declaration: (Productions 33 through 38 have been removed.) For example: A simple declaration for xml:lang might take the form An example of a start-tag: An example of an end-tag: Examples of empty elements: where the Name gives the element type being declared. An element type MUST NOT be declared more than once. Examples of element type declarations: Examples of element-content models: Examples of mixed content declarations: To define the set of attributes pertaining to a given element type. To establish type constraints for these attributes. An element type MUST NOT have more than one ID attribute specified. Examples of attribute-list declarations: Begin with a normalized value consisting of the empty string. For another character, append the character to the normalized value. An example: A parsed entity MUST NOT contain a recursive reference to itself, either directly or indirectly. Examples of character and entity references: Example of a parameter-entity reference: An internal entity is a parsed entity. Example of an internal entity declaration: If the NDataDecl is present, this is a general unparsed entity; otherwise it is a parsed entity. The original character is replaced by the resulting character sequence. Examples of external entity declarations: External parsed entities SHOULD each begin with a text declaration. Only parsed entities that are referenced directly or indirectly within the document are required to be well-formed. Examples of text declarations containing encoding declarations: . a reference to an external entity in an attribute value. while this is not: matches any Char with a value in the range(s) indicated (inclusive). matches A or nothing; optional A. matches A or B. matches any string that matches A but does not match B.  Other notations used in the productions are:  comment. well-formedness constraint; this identifies by name a constraint on well-formed documents associated with a production. Characters ':' and '_' are allowed as name-start characters. Characters '-' and '.' are allowed as name characters. If the DTD contains the declaration This produces the following: In the following example If the definition of x had been With a Byte Order Mark: Without a Byte Order Mark: Variation selector characters should not be used in names.

This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. The design goals for XML are: XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet. XML shall support a wide variety of applications. XML shall be compatible with SGML. It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents. XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear. The XML design should be prepared quickly. The design of XML shall be formal and concise. XML documents shall be easy to create. Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance. Taken as a whole, it matches the production labeled document. It meets all the well-formedness constraints given in this specification. Matching the document production implies that: It contains one or more elements. This section defines some symbols used widely in the grammar. [Definition: A Name is an Nmtoken with a restricted set of initial characters.]  Disallowed initial characters for Names include digits, diacritics, the full stop and the hyphen. An example of a comment: and so is this: The external subset, if any, MUST match the production for extSubset. An example of an XML document with a document type declaration: The declarations can also be given locally, as in this example: An example XML declaration with a standalone document declaration: (Productions 33 through 38 have been removed.) For example: A simple declaration for xml:lang might take the form An example of a start-tag: An example of an end-tag: Examples of empty elements: where the Name gives the element type being declared. An element type MUST NOT be declared more than once. Examples of element type declarations: Examples of element-content models: Examples of mixed content declarations: To define the set of attributes pertaining to a given element type. To establish type constraints for these attributes. An element type MUST NOT have more than one ID attribute specified. Examples of attribute-list declarations: Begin with a normalized value consisting of the empty string. For another character, append the character to the normalized value. An example: A parsed entity MUST NOT contain a recursive reference to itself, either directly or indirectly. Examples of character and entity references: Example of a parameter-entity reference: An internal entity is a parsed entity. Example of an internal entity declaration: If the NDataDecl is present, this is a general unparsed entity; otherwise it is a parsed entity. The original character is replaced by the resulting character sequence. Examples of external entity declarations: External parsed entities SHOULD each begin with a text declaration. Only parsed entities that are referenced directly or indirectly within the document are required to be well-formed. Examples of text declarations containing encoding declarations: . a reference to an external entity in an attribute value. while this is not: matches any Char with a value in the range(s) indicated (inclusive). matches A or nothing; optional A. matches A or B. matches any string that matches A but does not match B.  Other notations used in the productions are:  comment. well-formedness constraint; this identifies by name a constraint on well-formed documents associated with a production. Characters ':' and '_' are allowed as name-start characters. Characters '-' and '.' are allowed as name characters. If the DTD contains the declaration This produces the following: In the following example If the definition of x had been With a Byte Order Mark: Without a Byte Order Mark: Variation selector characters should not be used in names.

The errata list for this second edition is available at http://www.w3.org/2004/03/xmlschema-errata. This document sets out the structural part (XML Schema: Structures) of the XML Schema definition language. The non-normative appendices include the DTD for Schemas (non-normative) (&#xa7;G) and a Glossary (non-normative) (&#xa7;F). References to properties of information items as defined in [XML-Infoset] are notated as links to the relevant section thereof, set off with square brackets, for example [children]. The secondary components, which must have names, are as follows: In XML 1.0, the name and content of an element must correspond exactly to the element type referenced in the corresponding content model. If the simple type definition used in an item's &#xb7;validation&#xb7; is the &#xb7;simple ur-type definition&#xb7;, the &#xb7;normalized value&#xb7; must be determined as in the preserve case above. Attribute declarations provide for: The {name} property must match the local part of the names of attributes being &#xb7;validated&#xb7;. The value of the attribute must conform to the supplied {type definition}. All attribute declarations (see Attribute Declarations (&#xa7;3.2)) must satisfy the following constraints. Element declarations provide for: See below at XML Representation of Identity-constraint Definition Schema Components (&#xa7;3.11.2) for &lt;key&gt;, &lt;unique&gt; and &lt;keyref&gt;. All element declarations (see Element Declarations (&#xa7;3.3)) must satisfy the following constraint. The following constraints define relations appealed to elsewhere in this specification. Complex Type Definitions provide for: All complex type definitions (see Complex Type Definitions (&#xa7;3.4)) must satisfy the following constraints. The following constraint defines a relation appealed to elsewhere in this specification. The attribute use schema component has the following properties: None as such. None as such. All attribute uses (see AttributeUses (&#xa7;3.5)) must satisfy the following constraints. None as such. None as such. All attribute group definitions (see Attribute Group Definitions (&#xa7;3.6)) must satisfy the following constraint. {model group} is the Model Group (&#xa7;2.2.3.1) for which the model group definition provides a name. None as such. None as such. All model group definitions (see Model Group Definitions (&#xa7;3.7)) must satisfy the following constraint. None as such. All model groups (see Model Groups (&#xa7;3.8)) must satisfy the following constraints. The following constraints define relations appealed to elsewhere in this specification. The particle schema component has the following properties: None as such. None as such. All particles (see Particles (&#xa7;3.9)) must satisfy the following constraints. The following constraints define relations appealed to elsewhere in this specification. The wildcard schema component has the following properties: None as such. All wildcards (see Wildcards (&#xa7;3.10)) must satisfy the following constraint. The following constraints define a relation appealed to elsewhere in this specification.   Overall the augmentations to XML's ID/IDREF mechanism are: All identity-constraint definitions (see Identity-constraint Definitions (&#xa7;3.11)) must satisfy the following constraint. Notation declarations reconstruct XML 1.0 NOTATION declarations. None as such. All notation declarations (see Notation Declarations (&#xa7;3.12)) must satisfy the following constraint. None as such. All annotations (see Annotations (&#xa7;3.13)) must satisfy the following constraint. None as such. The following constraint defines relations appealed to elsewhere in this specification. A schema consists of a set of schema components. At the abstract level, the schema itself is just a container for its components. A schema is represented in XML by one or more &#xb7;schema documents&#xb7;, that is, one or more &lt;schema&gt; element information items.  A &#xb7;schema document&#xb7; contains representations for a collection of schema components, e.g. type definitions and element declarations, which have a common {target namespace}.  A &#xb7;schema document&#xb7; which has one or more &lt;import&gt; element information items corresponds to a schema with components with more than one {target namespace}, see Import Constraints and Semantics (&#xa7;4.2.3). The definition of the schema abstract data model in XML Schema Abstract Data Model (&#xa7;2.2) makes clear that most components have a {target namespace}.  Most components corresponding to representations within a given &lt;schema&gt; element information item will have a {target namespace} which corresponds to the targetNamespace attribute.  All schemas (see Schemas as a Whole (&#xa7;3.15)) must satisfy the following constraint. The architecture of schema-aware processing allows for a rich characterization of XML documents:  schema validity is not a binary predicate. This specification requires as a precondition for &#xb7;assessment&#xb7; an information set as defined in [XML-Infoset] which supports at least the following information items and properties: In addition, infosets should support the [unparsedEntities] property of the Document Information Item.  Failure to do so will mean all items of type ENTITY or ENTITIES will fail to &#xb7;validate&#xb7;. This appendix is intended to satisfy the requirements for Conformance to the [XML-Infoset] specification. David Fallside, IBMScott Lawrence, Agranat SystemsAndrew Layman, MicrosoftEve L.

The errata list for this second edition is available at http://www.w3.org/2004/03/xmlschema-errata. This document sets out the structural part (XML Schema: Structures) of the XML Schema definition language. The non-normative appendices include the DTD for Schemas (non-normative) (&#xa7;G) and a Glossary (non-normative) (&#xa7;F). References to properties of information items as defined in [XML-Infoset] are notated as links to the relevant section thereof, set off with square brackets, for example [children]. The secondary components, which must have names, are as follows: In XML 1.0, the name and content of an element must correspond exactly to the element type referenced in the corresponding content model. If the simple type definition used in an item's &#xb7;validation&#xb7; is the &#xb7;simple ur-type definition&#xb7;, the &#xb7;normalized value&#xb7; must be determined as in the preserve case above. Attribute declarations provide for: The {name} property must match the local part of the names of attributes being &#xb7;validated&#xb7;. The value of the attribute must conform to the supplied {type definition}. All attribute declarations (see Attribute Declarations (&#xa7;3.2)) must satisfy the following constraints. Element declarations provide for: See below at XML Representation of Identity-constraint Definition Schema Components (&#xa7;3.11.2) for &lt;key&gt;, &lt;unique&gt; and &lt;keyref&gt;. All element declarations (see Element Declarations (&#xa7;3.3)) must satisfy the following constraint. The following constraints define relations appealed to elsewhere in this specification. Complex Type Definitions provide for: All complex type definitions (see Complex Type Definitions (&#xa7;3.4)) must satisfy the following constraints. The following constraint defines a relation appealed to elsewhere in this specification. The attribute use schema component has the following properties: None as such. None as such. All attribute uses (see AttributeUses (&#xa7;3.5)) must satisfy the following constraints. None as such. None as such. All attribute group definitions (see Attribute Group Definitions (&#xa7;3.6)) must satisfy the following constraint. {model group} is the Model Group (&#xa7;2.2.3.1) for which the model group definition provides a name. None as such. None as such. All model group definitions (see Model Group Definitions (&#xa7;3.7)) must satisfy the following constraint. None as such. All model groups (see Model Groups (&#xa7;3.8)) must satisfy the following constraints. The following constraints define relations appealed to elsewhere in this specification. The particle schema component has the following properties: None as such. None as such. All particles (see Particles (&#xa7;3.9)) must satisfy the following constraints. The following constraints define relations appealed to elsewhere in this specification. The wildcard schema component has the following properties: None as such. All wildcards (see Wildcards (&#xa7;3.10)) must satisfy the following constraint. The following constraints define a relation appealed to elsewhere in this specification.   Overall the augmentations to XML's ID/IDREF mechanism are: All identity-constraint definitions (see Identity-constraint Definitions (&#xa7;3.11)) must satisfy the following constraint. Notation declarations reconstruct XML 1.0 NOTATION declarations. None as such. All notation declarations (see Notation Declarations (&#xa7;3.12)) must satisfy the following constraint. None as such. All annotations (see Annotations (&#xa7;3.13)) must satisfy the following constraint. None as such. The following constraint defines relations appealed to elsewhere in this specification. A schema consists of a set of schema components. At the abstract level, the schema itself is just a container for its components. A schema is represented in XML by one or more &#xb7;schema documents&#xb7;, that is, one or more &lt;schema&gt; element information items.  A &#xb7;schema document&#xb7; contains representations for a collection of schema components, e.g. type definitions and element declarations, which have a common {target namespace}.  A &#xb7;schema document&#xb7; which has one or more &lt;import&gt; element information items corresponds to a schema with components with more than one {target namespace}, see Import Constraints and Semantics (&#xa7;4.2.3). The definition of the schema abstract data model in XML Schema Abstract Data Model (&#xa7;2.2) makes clear that most components have a {target namespace}.  Most components corresponding to representations within a given &lt;schema&gt; element information item will have a {target namespace} which corresponds to the targetNamespace attribute.  All schemas (see Schemas as a Whole (&#xa7;3.15)) must satisfy the following constraint. The architecture of schema-aware processing allows for a rich characterization of XML documents:  schema validity is not a binary predicate. This specification requires as a precondition for &#xb7;assessment&#xb7; an information set as defined in [XML-Infoset] which supports at least the following information items and properties: In addition, infosets should support the [unparsedEntities] property of the Document Information Item.  Failure to do so will mean all items of type ENTITY or ENTITIES will fail to &#xb7;validate&#xb7;. This appendix is intended to satisfy the requirements for Conformance to the [XML-Infoset] specification. David Fallside, IBMScott Lawrence, Agranat SystemsAndrew Layman, MicrosoftEve L.

This document specifies Best Practices for delivering Web content to mobile devices. The principal objective is to improve the user experience of the Web when accessed from such devices. The recommendations refer to delivered content and not to the processes by which it is created, nor to the devices or user agents to which it is delivered. It is primarily directed at creators, maintainers and operators of Web sites. Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with the creation of Web sites, and to have a general familiarity with the technologies involved, such as Web servers and HTTP.

Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/. This document was developed by the Best Practices Working Group (BPWG) as part of the Mobile Web Initiative. Please see the Working Group's implementation report. Changes since the previous version of the document are editorial. A complete list of changes made to this document is available. Note the document stayed in Proposed Recommendation for more than a year as it depended on the progress of XHTML Basic 1.1 on the Recommendation track. Please send comments about this document to public-bpwg-comments@w3.org (with public archive). This document combines the experience of many mobile Web stakeholders into one set of best practices, regarded as essential by the participants of the Working Group. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy. This document is informative only. W3C maintains a  public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a  patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which  the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy. The following Best Practices are discussed in this document and listed here for convenience. There is also a free-standing summary.  This document sets out a series of recommendations designed to improve the user experience of the Web on mobile devices.  The recommendations are offered to creators, maintainers and operators of Web sites and are intended as the basis for assessing conformance to the mobileOK trustmark, which is described in the Mobile Web Best Practices Working Group Charter and is not developed in this  document.  At the time of writing of this document, documents describing mobileOK and techniques for implementing the Best Practice recommendations are being worked on. The document is organized as follows: Introduction. Describes the audience, purpose and scope of the document. Requirements. An illustration of the type of problems that the Best Practices are intended to ameliorate. Delivery Context. Discusses the environment within which mobile access to the Web is realized, with particular reference to adaptation. Overview of Best Practices. A discussion of the organization of the Best Practices, and sources from which they were derived. Best Practices. The statements themselves. Conformance and mobileOK. A brief conformance statement and reference to the mobileOK documentation. Appendices Sources Related Reading Acknowledgements References Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with the creation of Web sites, and to have a general familiarity with the technologies involved, such as Web servers and HTTP. Readers are not expected to have a background in mobile-specific technologies. Our intention is to make it clear to all involved what the Best Practices are, and hence establish a common basis of understanding. As a result of wishing to be clear to those not already involved in the development of mobile friendly content, some of our statements may appear to be obvious or trivial to those with experience in this area. The document is not targeted solely at developers; others, such as interaction and graphic designers are encouraged to read it. The scope of these Best Practices is laid out in "Scope of Mobile Web Best Practices" [Scope]. In summary, this document refers primarily to the extension of Web browsing onto mobile devices. The Best Practice recommendations refer to delivered content. While they are clearly relevant to the processes of content creation and rendering on devices, they are not intended to be Best Practices for those activities. As the goal of the document is to specify Best Practices for delivery to mobile devices, statements that do not have a specific mobile aspect are not included. In particular, many Web Content Accessibility [WCAG] guidelines are general to all forms of Web access and are not repeated here unless they have a specific mobile interpretation. Examples of general good practice which have a specific mobile interpretation include "Error Messages" and "Color".  See B Related Reading for information about the related topics of Internationalization, Web Accessibility and Device Independence. As discussed in the Scope document [Scope] there are many  aspects to Mobile Web Best Practices. At present, for example, the design and construction of many Web sites and pages make for a poor user experience when they are viewed on a mobile device. The quality of the user's Web experience via a mobile device depends significantly on the usability of Web sites, of browsers, and of the device itself. Although browser usability  and device usability are important (for reading, navigating, and interacting with content), this document focuses primarily on Best Practices for improving site usability. In future phases other aspects may be considered - e.g. Best Practices as applied to  adaptation and devices. Also in future phases the scope of the recommendations may be extended beyond "Traditional Web Browsing" into fields such as multimodal interaction. These recommendations are in part derived from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG]. As noted above, WCAG guidelines are supplementary to the Mobile Web Best Practices, whose scope is limited to matters that have a specific mobile relevance. This document builds on some of the concepts described by the Device Independence Working  Group (DIWG) in the Device Independence Principles [DIP]. The document discusses device and delivery channel characteristics, which the DIWG has named "Delivery Context"  [DCODI]. In addition, the document uses some terminology from DIWG's Glossary of Terms for  Device Independence [DIGLOSS]. The BPWG is developing a companion document describing techniques [Techniques] by which the Best Practice statements in this document can be implemented. The Best Practices have been written at a level of generality that allows them to be applicable across a range of markup languages. They have been written with enduring properties of mobile access to the Web in mind. While the factors identified in 3.7 Default Delivery Context, such as screen dimensions, will change over time, it seems likely that the distinguishing features of mobile access such as cost and difficulty of input will remain issues. This document may be reviewed from time to time. When necessary, an updated version will be released with clear documentation as to the changes that have been introduced. This section discusses the requirements of the Mobile Web Best Practice statements in section 5. The statement of requirements is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive or complete. Today, Many Web pages are laid out for presentation on desktop size displays, and exploit capabilities of desktop browsing software. Accessing such a Web page on a mobile device often results in a poor or unusable experience. Contributing factors include pages not being laid out as intended. Because of the limited screen size and the limited amount of material that is visible to the user, context and overview are lost. Because of the limited screen size, the subject matter of the page may require considerable scrolling to be visible, especially if the top of the page is occupied by images and navigation links. In these cases the user gets no immediate feedback as to whether their retrieval has resulted in the right content. It is particularly important in the mobile context to help the user create a mental image of the site. This can be assisted by adopting a consistent style and can be considerably diminished by an uneven style. Mobile device input is often difficult when compared with use of a desktop device equipped with a keyboard. Mobile devices often have only a very limited keypad, with small keys, and there is frequently no pointing device. One of the difficulties of the mobile Web is that URIs are very difficult to type. Lengthy URIs and those that contain a lot of punctuation are particularly difficult to type correctly.  Because of the limitations of screen and input, forms are hard to fill in. This is because navigation between fields may not occur in the expected order and because of the difficulty in typing into the fields. While many modern devices provide back buttons, some do not, and in some cases, where back functionality exists, users may not know how to invoke it. This means that it is often very hard to recover from errors, broken links and so on. Mobile networks can be slow compared with fixed data connections and often have a measurably higher latency. This can lead to long retrieval times, especially for lengthy content and for content that requires a lot of navigation between pages. Mobile data transfer often costs money. The fact that mobile devices frequently support only limited types of content means that a user may follow a link and retrieve information that is unusable on their device. Even if the content type can be interpreted by their device there is often an issue with the experience not being satisfactory - for example, larger images may only be viewable in small pieces and require considerable scrolling. Web pages can contain content that the user has not specifically requested - especially advertising and large images. In the mobile world this extra material contributes to poor usability and may add considerably to the cost of the retrieval. Mobile users typically have different interests to users of fixed or desktop devices. They are likely to have more immediate and goal-directed intentions than desktop Web users. Their intentions are often to find out specific pieces of information that are relevant to their context. An example of such a goal-directed application might be the user requiring specific information about schedules for a journey they are currently undertaking. Equally, mobile users are typically less interested in lengthy documents or in browsing. The ergonomics of the device are frequently unsuitable for reading lengthy documents, and users will often only access such information from mobile devices as a last resort, because more convenient access is not available. Developers of commercial Web sites should note that different commercial models are often at work when the Web is accessed from mobile devices as compared with desktop devices. For example, some mechanisms that are commonly used for presentation of advertising material (such as pop-ups, pop-unders and large banners) do not work well on small devices and are therefore contrary to Best Practice recommendations such as [CENTRAL_MEANING], [LARGE_GRAPHICS] and [POP_UPS]. It is not the intention of the MWI to limit or to restrict advertising; rather it is the intention that the user experience of the site as a whole, including advertising, if any, is as effective as possible. As noted above, the restrictions imposed by the keyboard and the screen typically require a different approach to page design than for desktop devices. As detailed in the Scope document [Scope], various other limitations may apply and these have an impact on the usability of the Web from a mobile device. Mobile browsers often do not support scripting or plug-ins, which means that the range of content that they support is limited. In many cases the user has no choice of browser and upgrading it is not possible. Some activities associated with rendering Web pages are computationally intensive - for example re-flowing pages, laying out tables, processing unnecessarily long and complex style sheets and handling invalid markup [T-MOB]. Mobile devices typically have quite limited processing power which means that page rendering may take a noticeable time to complete. As well as introducing a noticeable delay, such processing uses more power as does communication with the server. Many devices have limited memory available for pages and images, and exceeding their memory limitations results in incomplete display and can cause other problems. In discussing the limitations of mobile devices for delivery of Web content it is easy to lose sight of the fact that they are extremely popular and very common. This popularity largely stems at present from them being: personal personalizable portable connected and increasingly multi-functional beyond their original purpose of voice communications. In addition to these factors, the advantages of mobile devices will increasingly include: location awareness one-handed operation always on universal alerting device By way of illustration of some of these factors: the Web can go where you go. You do not have to remember to do something on the Web when you get back to your computer. You can do it immediately, within the context that made you want to use the Web in the first place. Moreover, with mobile devices appearing in all shapes and forms, and  with a growing variety of features like location technology, cameras, voice recognition, touch screens etc, the Web can reach a much wider audience, and at all times in all situations. It has the opportunity to reach into places where wires cannot go, to places previously unthinkable (e.g. providing medical info to mountain rescue scenes) and to accompany everyone as easily as they carry the time on their wristwatches. Finally, today, many more people have access to mobile devices than access to a desktop computer. This is likely to be very significant in developing countries, where Web-capable mobile devices may play as similar a role in deploying wide-spread Web access as the mobile phone has played for providing "plain old telephone service". The recommendations in this document are intended to improve the experience of the Web on mobile devices. While the recommendations are not specifically addressed at the desktop browsing experience, it must be understood that they are made in the context of wishing to work towards "One Web".  As discussed in the Scope document [Scope], One Web means making, as far as is reasonable, the same information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are using. However, it does not mean that exactly the same information is available in exactly the same representation across all devices. The context of mobile use, device capability variations, bandwidth issues and mobile network capabilities all affect the representation. Furthermore, some services and information are more suitable for and targeted at particular user contexts (see 5.1.1 Thematic Consistency of Resource Identified by a URI). Some services have a primarily mobile appeal (location based services, for example). Some have a primarily mobile appeal but have a complementary desktop aspect (for instance for complex configuration tasks). Still others have a primarily desktop appeal but a complementary mobile aspect (possibly for alerting). Finally there will remain some Web applications that have a primarily desktop appeal (lengthy reference material, rich images, for example). It is likely that application designers and service providers will wish to provide the best possible experience in the context in which their service has the most appeal. However, while services may be most appropriately experienced in one context or another, it is considered best practice to provide as reasonable experience as is possible given device limitations and not to exclude access from any particular class of device, except where this is necessary because of device limitations. From the perspective of this document this means that services should be available as some variant of HTML over HTTP (see 3.7 Default Delivery Context). The widely varying characteristics of mobile devices can make it difficult for a Web site to provide an acceptable user experience across a significant range of devices. For example different devices support different markup features and different screen sizes may demand different sized images. Consequently, it is very common when delivering content to mobile devices to vary the details of the markup, format of images, image sizes, color depths and so on to suit the characteristics of the device in question. The process of altering content to enhance the user experience on particular devices is referred to as Content Adaptation. We do not describe adaptation in detail in this document. For a more detailed description, readers are referred to the Device Independence Principles [DIP]. In addition, the sister group of the Best Practices Working Group, the Device Description Working Group, is currently defining requirements for a repository of mobile device characteristics that are relevant to content adaptation. There are a number of different implementation models for content adaptation. On the one hand, adaptation may be quite simple and consist of determining the device type and choosing the most appropriate set of previously prepared content to match the device characteristics. At the other extreme it may be carried out in a completely dynamic way, with content formatted at the time of retrieval, taking into account not only statically determined properties, such as screen dimension, but also dynamically determined properties, such as the temporary attachment of a fully featured keyboard.  Adaptation can be carried out in a number of different points in the delivery of content to the device [DCODI]: Whatever the adaptation model at work, the process of adaptation should not diminish accessibility. In phase 1 (See 1.4.1 Phasing) it is assumed that content adaptation, if any, is carried out Server Side. Future phases may consider the implications of content adaptation elsewhere, especially the issues concerning the granting of authority to third parties to carry out adaptation, prohibiting adaptation and so on. Later phases may also address multiple adaptation - i.e. the possibility that adaptation can be applied at more than one point and that In-Network adaptation may occur more than once. It is also assumed that it is possible to create a site that is consistent with the Best Practice recommendations without carrying out adaptation at all. However it is likely that a more sophisticated and enhanced user experience will be achieved if adaptation is used. Providing variations on the user experience that are appropriate in different cases requires the content provider to know a significant amount about the characteristics of the device, the properties of the browser in use and the transparency of the network connection to the device. For simple sites that present an interface which is similar across a broad range of contexts the need for such information is diminished when compared with a sophisticated site that has an optimized navigation structure, presents different size images or carries out other adaptations to suit the particular delivery context. There are several methods by which a content provider can discover information about the delivery context, such as  CC/PP, UAPROF, CSS Media Queries and various outputs of the Device Independence Working Group. The companion Techniques [Techniques] document describes these methods. In the interests of "One Web" (see 3.1 One Web) considerations, the content provider may choose to allow the user to select from broad categories such as mobile or desktop presentation, where these are distinguished in the application. If the presentation option has been determined automatically, the content provider may choose to allow the user to override the automatic determination. Where a choice of presentations is available, it is good practice to record the user's preferences and to allow them to be changed. Given an appropriate server environment, it is unlikely that the content provider will be unable to find out anything about the delivery context. However this can happen, either because details of the delivery context are not available in sufficient detail or because the server does not provide the ability to inspect and act on the information provided. In this case a "reasonable default experience" should be provided. The details of the default experience depend upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the geographic region in which the service is offered and the primary intention of the service (e.g. considering whether the service is primarily desktop focused vs. primarily mobile focused). In order to allow content providers to share a consistent view of a default mobile experience the BPWG has defined the Default Delivery Context. This allows providers to create appropriate experiences in the absence of adaptation and provides a baseline experience where adaptation is used. The Default Delivery Context has been determined by the BPWG as being the minimum delivery context specification necessary for a reasonable experience of the Web. It is recognized that devices that do not meet this specification can provide a reasonable experience of other non-Web services. It is also recognized that this specification is made against the background of demographic, cultural and economic assumptions. Content providers may choose to provide services that demand a different or lower delivery context specification, but should try to provide an experience that exploits the capabilities of the Default Delivery Context in order to provide the best possible experience for that context. It is stressed that many devices exceed the capabilities defined by the DDC. Content providers are encouraged not to diminish the user experience on those devices by developing only to the DDC specification, and are encouraged to adapt their content, where appropriate, to exploit the capabilities of the actual device. In summary, the purpose of defining the DDC is to support the following rules: If an adaptation process is used, then information that is known about the actual Delivery Context should (see 5.1.2 Exploit Device Capabilities) be used to vary the delivered content to make it more suitable for that specific Delivery Context or to provide an enhanced user experience. If the delivered content does not result from an adaptation process - e.g. the content is statically defined as HTML stored in files, or the details of the Delivery Context cannot adequately be determined, then the delivered content should be suitable for the Default Delivery Context and should comply with the Best Practice statements. The Default Delivery Context is defined as follows: 120 pixels, minimum. XHTML Basic 1.1 [XHTML-Basic] delivered with content type application/xhtml+xml. UTF-8 [UTF-8]. JPEG. GIF 89a. 20 kilobytes. 256 Colors, minimum. CSS Level 1 [CSS]. In addition, CSS Level 2 [CSS2] @media  rule together with the handheld and all media types (see CSS 2 Media Types). HTTP/1.0 [HTTP1.0] or more recent [HTTP1.1]. No support for client side scripting. The functional area that is addressed by the statements. One or more Best Practice statements, identified in the following way: An explanation of the significance of the statements under this heading.  A discussion of techniques and some suggestions as to how to implement. The BPWG is creating a separate document describing techniques [Techniques] in more detail. The aspects of the delivered content that an external validator could examine to assess conformance with the Best Practice statements. This section is not present for process related statements. In this section it is noted whether the statement is Machine Testable (Automated testing is possible) or Human Testable (Testing requires human assessment). Some Best Practices are partially machine testable, i.e. based on the result of an automated test, some human interaction may be required. In such cases both a Machine Testable and a Human Testable statement are present. Some Best Practice statements use words such as "minimize" and "avoid" which are intentionally non-prescriptive. This is in order to provide   guidance while leaving room to accommodate a wide variety of applications whose requirements cannot be anticipated. It also allows creativity and diversity within the same Best Practice framework. More prescriptive advice can be found in the Techniques document [Techniques]. Where appropriate, references to related WCAG points and other immediate references from the preceding text. The Best Practice statements are grouped under the following headings There are some general principles that underlie delivery to mobile devices.  A bookmark captured on one device should be usable on another, different type of device even if it does not yield exactly the same experience. If the page that was bookmarked is not appropriate for the device that is now using it,  an alternative that is suitable should be provided.  Just as in the desktop world, there are browsers that do not respect the intentions of the content provider. There are differences in interpretation between browsers and there are also deficiencies in implementation. By deficient we mean non-support of mandatory features of a relevant standard or recommendation and other bugs or errors in implementation.  Just as it is not the intention to recommend a least common denominator approach, neither is it the intention to recommend avoiding features that exhibit problems on some class of devices. It is also not the intention to suggest that content providers should restrict their support to certain device types. Content providers should aim to support as wide a range of device types as is practical. Any Web site should be tested in a range of browsers. Mobile browsers often show markedly different characteristics to desktop browsers. As well as assessing a site's suitability for display in reduced format, content providers are encouraged to test that the features they rely on work in actual devices.  Content providers should also test with specific features disabled, such as using text-only modes and with scripting disabled. Many manufacturers provide emulators for their device that can provide a convenient preliminary means of testing. However, in practice, many of the emulators behave in a different way to the devices they emulate. Consequently testing should be carried out in as wide a range of real devices and specific software versions as is practical. Because of the limitations in display and of input mechanisms, the possible absence of a pointing device and other constraints of mobile devices, care should be exercised in defining the structure and the navigation model of a Web site. allow and instead of  allow Provide the basic links on a single line.  The design should aim to provide a balance between having a large number of navigation links on a page and the need to navigate multiple links to reach content. Using the same navigation mechanisms across a service helps users orient themselves and allows them to identify navigation mechanisms more easily. At each target of the drill-down navigation an "up" link should be provided to allow the user to jump up an entire section. This relates to WCAG 13.4. Where there is no pointing device, assigning an access key (keyboard short cut) to a link can provide a convenient way for users to access the link and avoid navigating to the link by repeated pressing of the navigation key. Machine Test: Test for the presence of the accesskey attribute. This relates to WCAG 9.5. Users of mobile devices may suffer undue delay and cost as a result of following links. It is important to identify where a link leads so users can make an assessment of whether following it will be of interest to them. While it is unlikely that the cost in monetary terms of a particular user following a particular link can be specified, it should be possible to give an idea of the size of the resource (in bytes or in an abstract way, e.g. large file). Links to content that is in a different format or different language to that of the page the link is on (i.e. content that can only be interpreted by other applications or downloads) should be human signposted, so that users are not lead to download content that their device may not be able to use. However, bear in mind that some devices support the rendering of those formats by other applications once downloaded (e.g. music files). Additionally, users may wish to download content for later transfer to other devices altogether. So even if it is known that the user agent does not support a particular content type, that content should still be made available. For the Default Delivery Context all formats other than XHTML, GIF and JPG should be noted.  Human Test: Check for proper descriptions (e.g. no use of "Click here"). Machine Test: Check for links to non-HTML formats. Human Test: If present check whether there is information about the format of the target of the link. This relates to WCAG 11.3 and 13.1. Many mobile devices lack a pointing device and server-side image maps cannot be used on such devices. For the Default Delivery Context, or if a satisfactory image map cannot be displayed, use a list of links with descriptive text instead. IMAGE_MAPS Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that does not support client-side image maps and check the map element is not present. This relates to WCAG 1.2 and 9.1. Each of these activities is likely to cause the user confusion, or add cost and delay to their interaction. Some mobile devices use a separate window for input; this section does not refer to such windows. Many mobile devices cannot support more than one window and consequently, attempting to open one will have unpredictable results. While redirection is a commonly employed mechanism, it must be remembered that redirection usually requires a round-trip to the browser. This adds to delay on slow links; so use a maximum of one redirect per page and limit the number of pages that are redirected. POP_UPS Machine Test: Look for the target attribute on links and if present check to see if it has a value different from _self, _parent or _top. AUTO_REFRESH  Machine Test: Check whether meta http-equiv="refresh" content="&lt;the same URI&gt;" is used. REDIRECTION Machine Test: Check whether meta http-equiv="refresh" content="&lt;a different URI&gt;" is used. This relates to WCAG 7.4, 7.5 and 10.1. Each linked resource (images, style sheets and other objects) requires a separate request across the network. This may add significantly to the load time of the page in the mobile context. Minimize the number of images on a page and consolidate style information into a single sheet per page (see also 5.4.9 Style Sheets). Machine Test: Count the number of linked images, style sheets and other linked items. Human Test: Review whether a similar effect could be obtained using fewer links. Users in a mobile context are often looking for specific pieces of information, rather than browsing. Content providers should consider the likely context of use of information and, while providing the option to access all information, should offer appropriate information first. See also discussion under 2.4 User Goals and 3.1 One Web. The general prescription to use clear language is of particular importance for mobile delivery, where brevity and directness are generally more desirable than a discursive style. Writing content in the traditional journalistic "front loaded" style can assist users determining whether information is of interest to them and allow them to skip it more easily if it is not. Placing distinguishing information at the beginning of headings,  paragraphs, lists, etc. can also help the user contextualize when using devices with limited screen area. See also 5.3.4 Navigation Bars etc. (Extraneous material) for a discussion of making sure that the subject matter of the page is near the top. Mobile users often pay for bandwidth, so offering them content that is extraneous to their needs, especially advertising, costs them time and money and contributes to an unsatisfactory experience.  In general, the user's consent should be sought before initiating the download of content. Human Test: Examine content to determine if, given the subject matter, it is appropriate in a mobile context. This relates to WCAG 13.8 and 14.1. If pages are too big they may take an unduly long time to load. In addition, mobile devices typically have restrictions on the largest page they can accommodate. On the other hand, if pages are too short then the user will be required to make multiple requests to read the relevant information. This can lead to an unnecessary delay, since each request typically takes a measurable time to complete. The balance between pagination and scrolling is partly a matter of taste and partly a matter of necessity. Devices with severe memory restrictions can only have small pages delivered to them. Equally some devices offer a poor scrolling experience and a better page retrieval experience. Some studies [MF] have been carried out in this area to test for user preferences. Some of these indicate that users prefer scrolling to click-throughs and some indicate the contrary. More research is likely to be needed in this area.   For the Default Delivery Context assume the limits specified in 3.7 Default Delivery Context.  PAGE_SIZE_USABLE Machine Test: Measure the total size of the markup for a page; check that it does not exceed 10 kilobytes for the Default Delivery Context. Human Test: Check that the page is still usable (e.g. not cut in the middle of a sentence, just before the end of a section, and so on). PAGE_SIZE_LIMIT Machine Test: Measure the total size of markup and images for a page; check that it does not go over the allowed size for the device - 20 kilobytes for the Default Delivery Context. This relates to WCAG 12.3. The page should lay out so that simple repeated scrolling in the same direction (axis) allows the user to experience all its content. However some content (such as maps and other images) cannot be displayed without secondary scrolling.  If some element on the page requires secondary scrolling it must not cause the remainder of the page to require this. For example, if an object causes subsequent text to lay out with a significant margin to its left, then this text may not be visible once a user has scrolled past the object. Equally, if the presence of such an object causes text to render beyond the right boundary of the page then the user will be required to scroll to read each line of text. If it is not possible to avoid presenting images that are larger than the screen size, then consider providing these images on a separate page with a link back to the main content. In the Default Delivery Context assume a width of 120 pixels. SCROLLING Machine Test: Check for width attributes and width style properties wider than the screen size - for the Default Delivery Context, 120 pixels. Human Test: If it is wider than the screen size, check that the use case warrants it (e.g. maps). Browse URIs within a site with a mobile device and observe that on pages with elements that require secondary scrolling only those elements require it, and the rest of the page requires only primary scrolling. Many Web pages are designed with significant navigational and other elements at the top of or to the side of the page (e.g. Menu Bars, Breadcrumb Trails and Search Functions). This provides a convenient and well-understood navigational metaphor on large displays. However, on small displays this can result in the navigation appearing instead of the actual content of the page when the page is first retrieved.  Because it is important for the user to gain an idea of the content of the page on initial view, there should be a minimum amount of clutter preceding this - including navigation, decorative images, advertising and other material that is not central to the user's experience of the page. The user should not have to scroll significantly to find the primary content of the page. See also 5.3.1 Page Content for a discussion of how writing style can help the user identify meaning. Human test: Browse URIs within a site with a mobile device and observe that the most important/relevant information is conveyed first. This relates to WCAG 13.5. The popular mechanism of using a 1 pixel graphic for absolute positioning does not work on a variety of screens. GRAPHICS_FOR_SPACING Machine Test: Check for very small and/or transparent graphics. LARGE_GRAPHICS  Machine Test: Check dimensions of graphics. Mobile devices often do not have good color contrast and are often used in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. Hence information highlighted in color may not be visible to users. If color is used to indicate a feature then that feature should generally also be indicated in a way that is not color dependent. In particular, do not use blue or purple text, as this may be confused with hyperlinks, especially on devices that do not underline links. USE_OF_COLOR  Human Test: Browse the page in a monochrome environment. COLOR_CONTRAST Human Test: Browse the page under a strong light parallel to the screen. Machine Test: There are automatic tools to test color contrast. This relates to WCAG 2.1 and 2.2. Images that are used indiscriminately can lead to content that is hard to view, particularly with the limited contrast often found on mobile devices and in the hostile viewing conditions in which mobile devices are frequently used. Before using background images, consider carefully your objectives for doing so and try to use alternative techniques to achieve similar objectives. If you use a background image ensure that the content is readable with and without the background image for devices that do not support them. Machine Test: Test for the presence of a background image. Human Test: Test readability both on devices that support them and devices that do not. Provide a descriptive title for the page to allow easy identification. Keep the title short to reduce page weight, and bear in mind that it may be truncated. Many mobile browsers do not display the title of a page. Where the title is displayed the available space may be limited. The device may use the page title as the default label for bookmarks. Again, space may be limited, so use it to help identify the content and not for other purposes. Machine Test: Test for presence of the title element. Human Test: Test that the title is descriptive of content. Many mobile devices do not support frames. In addition, frames are recognized as being generally problematic.  Machine Test: Test for presence of frame related elements -  check for frameset and iframe elements. See  http://www.w3.org/TR/xframes/#s_intro for a discussion of problems with frames. It is good practice for all but the simplest documents to indicate their structure through headings and sub-headings. Using structural markup, rather than formatting effects, allows easier adaptation of content where it needs to be divided into several pages, as well as potentially facilitating access to the sections of the document that a user is interested in. Where headings are used they should be used in accordance with the specification, i.e. they should be properly nested according to their level. Structural markup must not be used solely to create a font effect (see also 5.4.3 Structural Elements). Markup languages like HMTL contain many constructs to indicate structure. Tables do not work well on limited size screens and may result in the user having to scroll horizontally to read them. Putting navigational links into tables may result in the user having both to scroll horizontally and vertically to see possible navigational choices. TABLES_SUPPORT Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that does not support tables and check the table element is not present. Machine Test: Check that there are no nested tables. TABLES_LAYOUT Machine Test: Check that no column or row in a table is empty or contains only a 1x1 transparent GIF. Machine Test: If there is a table element, check to see whether there is rendered content outside the element. If there is not then it is likely that the table is being used for layout. This relates to WCAG 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5 and 5.6. A non-text item is defined by Non-text content in the WAI Glossary [WAIGlossary]. Downloading images to a mobiledevice adds to the time to display an image and the cost of displaying the page. Making the page readable in text-only mode can help the user assess its usefulness before images arrive. Many mobile devices do not support embedded objects or script and in many cases it is not possible for users to load plug-ins to add support. Content must be designed with this in mind.  Even where a device does support scripting, do not use it unless there is no other way of accomplishing your objectives. Scripting increases power consumption and so decreases battery life. Design pages so that they are useful when rendered as text-only. See also 5.1.4 Testing. Always use features of the markup designed to support alternate rendering such as the longdesc and alt attributes in XHTML. Use only features from the markup that are known to be supported by the device in question. Avoid things like CSS image replacement and pictures of words. If scripting is used, do not use onmouse and onkey triggers, use onclick. NON-TEXT_ALTERNATIVES Machine Test: Test for presence of alt attribute on images and text content on objects. Human Test: Check the relevance of the meaning of the content of alt attributes. OBJECTS_OR_SCRIPT Machine Test: Test for the presence of object or script elements in content delivered to a device that does not support them and if present carry out the Human Test below. Human Test: If present, test that the user experience is acceptable. This relates to WCAG 1.1, 3.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 and 9.2. Note that this recommendation contrasts with 5.4.8 Measures, which recommends using relative measures where possible. IMAGES_SPECIFY_SIZE Machine Test: Test for presence of width and height attributes on img elements. IMAGES_RESIZING  Machine Test: Check width and height attributes are equal to image dimensions. If the page markup is invalid this will result in unpredictable and possibly incomplete presentation.  Machine Test: Validate documents. This relates to WCAG 3.2, 11.1 and 11.2.  See http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/#validators.  Avoiding pixel and absolute measures allows the browser to adapt content to fit the display. An exception to rule is where an image has been specifically sized for a particular display (see 5.4.6 Image Size). In this case references to the image in markup may specify the exact dimensions of the image in pixels, in order to help the browser to flow the page and avoid re-flowing it after the page has been retrieved. Devices may realize the intentions of authors more accurately if margins, borders and padding are specified in pixels. Use percentage and relative measures such as em, ex, bolder, larger and thick. Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that supports relative measures correctly and check the values of font-size are not absolute or pixels. Style information may be contained in an externally linked style sheet or, in HTML, may be contained either in a style element or in a style attribute on specific elements. Mobile devices offer varying support for style sheets. Some provide full implementations, including caching of external style sheets; some do not cache external style sheets; some do not support the style element; some implementations do not support more than one style sheet and some do not support style sheets at all. If style sheets are turned off or not supported, content will be rendered in document order, so it is important that the content makes sense when read in document order. Optimize style information so that only styles that are used are included. When creating style sheets, take advantage of the CSS media types (these may be used both in the CSS @media rule and in the media attribute of the link element) to specify styles that apply to handheld rendering. The CSS Media types that apply are "handheld" and "all". If handheld rendering is not specified, browsers may download other style sheets even if they are identified as applicable to non-handheld rendering STYLE_SHEETS_USE Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that supports CSS and check that style sheets are used and that the page does not use formatting tags (e.g. font). STYLE_SHEETS_SUPPORT  Human Test: Disable style sheets and check that the page is still readable.  STYLE_SHEETS_SIZE Machine Test: Check that the elements in a style sheet are used in at least one of the pages that reference it. This relates to WCAG 3.3 and 6.1 Content which is marked up in languages such as XML can often be made smaller while preserving exactly the same semantics merely by removal of redundant white space (i.e. spaces and new lines). Marking fonts, colors and other stylistic effects in-line can cause considerably larger page sizes when compared with using logical markup, and use of the HTML class attribute for application of style (see also 5.4.9 Style Sheets). If "pretty printing" is an important part of the authoring process, then try to arrange that redundant white space is stripped when serving a page. Use of structural markup (see 5.4.3 Structural Elements) contributes to minimizing the size of the markup on a page, as does centralizing the style descriptions using CSS [CSS]. Machine Test: Count the number of non-significant white space characters in the document. Transferring content that a device cannot display wastes users' time and money. A device may express a preference for formats. In this case it is good practice to respect the device's preference, as it may have a fuller implementation of those formats. There are problems with using any one approach to the exclusion of the others. Some issues that have been noted by the BPWG in this context are: Some devices do not supply accept headers; Some devices mis-state their capabilities; Some operator gateways supplement the accept headers to include formats that they adapt; User agent headers do not always uniquely identify the device; UAProf information may not be available or may be incomplete. CONTENT_FORMAT_SUPPORT Machine Test: Check MIME types of content with various devices. CONTENT_FORMAT_PREFERRED  Machine Test: Check MIME types of content with various devices and check that the preferred format is sent or that the format is compatible with the Default Delivery Context. As in the previous section, content should not be sent to a device if it can not use it. Machine Test: Check that the encoding is declared in some way and is supported. The content type may be declared in one or more of the following ways: The Content-Type HTTP header, the XML declaration for XML-based content, the CSS @charset rules for CSS, the Content-Type Meta element for HTML content. A "retry" link to attempt the relevant part of the transaction again (note that this may not be equivalent to a page "refresh"); Enter an extraneous URI, known not to represent an actual resource on the site, and check that a HTTP 404 error response is accompanied by a page whose markup is appropriate for the requesting device, or the default context. Cookies are frequently used to carry out session management, to identify users and to store user preferences. Many mobile devices do not implement cookies or offer only an incomplete implementation. In addition, some gateways strip cookies and others simulate cookies on behalf of mobile devices.  Test that cookies are supported by the device on its current access path. If they are not supported, use URI decoration for session management, being careful not to exceed the device's maximum length for such strings. Some gateways provide user identification without setting cookies.  Machine Test: Check that an alternative to cookies is used for session management when they are not available. Set expiry times in a way that is appropriate to your application. Consider using Cache-Control: public to allow sharing of pages between devices, Cache-Control: private to allow re-use but only by the requesting device and Cache-Control: nocache to prevent caching. Machine Test: Check for the presence of cache headers on the HTTP response. Mobile devices often have few fonts and limited support for font sizes and effects (bold, italic etc.) As a result of this, the use of font size, face or effect, for example to highlight an answer or a stressed word, may not achieve the desired effect. See also 5.4.3 Structural Elements. For the Default Delivery Context do not use font related styling. Machine Test: Check for the presence of font related styling in an environment that does not support it. Human Test: If present, ensure that the author's intentions remain clear. This section contains statements relating to user input. This is typically more restrictive on mobile devices than on desktop computers (and often a lot more restrictive). For example, mobile devices may lack pointing devices and often do not have a standard keyboard for text entry. Given the typical input limitations of a mobile device, the interface must as far as possible minimize user input. Where possible, use selection lists, radio buttons and other controls that do not require typing. Some markup languages allow the specification of an input mode, which is particularly useful in cases where user input is to be restricted, for example to numeric only. It is anticipated that XHTML-Basic [XHTML-Basic] will support this functionality in the future. There are a number of techniques available for this, including: Where possible use previous entries as defaults. Make it possible to select items using navigation keys and/or numeric input. AVOID_FREE_TEXT  Machine Test: Check whether input type="text" and textarea are used.  Human Test: If one of them is used, check whether it can be replaced by a pre-determined entry. PROVIDE_DEFAULTS  Machine Test: Check if there is a pre-selected value in controls (selected or checked attribute set).   Human Test: If not, check if there could be sensible pre-selection in the context (e.g. most common choice). DEFAULT_INPUT_MODE Machine Test: Send a request with a device known to support the inputmode attribute and if the response is in a language that supports this attribute, check that it is present on input type="text" and textarea elements. This relates to WCAG 10.4. It is important that as the user navigates through the page the various fields and objects are presented in a logical order, especially as many of them will not be visible at the same time as the focus item. Use document order to control layout and tab order. Machine Test: Check that there are no tabindex attributes or layout effects that affect the order of presentation.  If there are tabindex attributes check that all controls have a tab index and that they are used consistently. Human Test: If there are either tabindex attributes or layout effects that might affect the order of presentation, then check that the order is usable. This means use the label element in HTML, or its equivalent in other languages. Make sure that where the label goes is consistent and close to the form control so re-flowing or adapting the content intelligently will always recognize label controls and keep them together.  Machine Test: Check if the label element is used in forms.   Human Test: Check whether the labels are properly positioned with regard to the controls. This relates to WCAG 10.2 and 12.4.  The Best Practice statements are intended to be capable of  having conformance statements constructed around them in support of the mobileOK trustmark and for other purposes. Work on the mobileOK trustmark will develop specific recommended requirements for a trustmark, which will be based on some profile, or subset, of the  Statements in this document. All of the Best Practice statements have a fragment identifier to allow formal reference to them and allow the construction of compliance claims that refer to them. This specification may be compatible with other specifications that describe a different set of requirements for content, insofar as such requirements do not conflict with the current specification. The Best Practice statements have been assembled by the BPWG from a number of sources. Primary among those are: Various BPWG group meetings and discussions  The editors acknowledge significant written contributions from: Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0 Basic Guidelines W3C Recommendation 29 July 2008 Abstract Status of this Document Table of Contents List of Best Practices 1 Introduction 2 Requirements 3 Delivery Context 4 Structure of Best Practice Statements 5 Best Practice Statements 6 Conformance and mobileOK  A Sources (Non-Normative) B Related Reading (Non-Normative) C Acknowledgements (Non-Normative) D References (Non-Normative) Appendices 1.1 Purpose of the Document 1.2 How the Best Practices are Organized 1.3 Audience 1.4 Scope 1.5 Relationship to other Best Practices and recommendations 1.6 Longevity and Versioning 2.1 Presentation Issues 2.2 Input 2.3 Bandwidth and Cost 2.4 User Goals 2.5 Advertising 2.6 Device Limitations 2.7 Advantages 3.1 One Web 3.2 Background to Adaptation 3.3 Adaptation Implementation Model 3.4 Assumptions about Adaptation 3.5 Establishing Context 3.6 Choice of User Experience 3.7 Default Delivery Context 5.1 Overall Behavior 5.2 Navigation and Links 5.3 Page Layout and Content 5.4 Page Definition 5.5 User Input 6.1 Classes of Products 6.2 Extensibility D.1 MWI References D.2 Sources D.3 Device Independence D.4 Web, Protocols and Languages D.5 Other References 1.4.1 Phasing 5.1.1 Thematic Consistency of Resource Identified by a URI 5.1.2 Exploit Device Capabilities 5.1.3 Work around Deficient Implementations 5.1.4 Testing 5.2.1 URIs of Site Entry Points 5.2.2 Navigation Bar 5.2.3 Balanced Structure 5.2.4 Navigation Mechanisms 5.2.5 Access Keys 5.2.6 Link Target Identification 5.2.7 Image Maps 5.2.8 Refreshing, Redirection and Spawned Windows 5.2.9 Externally Linked Resources 5.3.1 Page Content 5.3.2 Page Size 5.3.3 Scrolling 5.3.4 Navigation Bars etc. (Extraneous material) 5.3.5 Graphics 5.3.6 Color 5.3.7 Background Images 5.4.1 Title 5.4.2 Frames 5.4.3 Structural Elements 5.4.4 Tables 5.4.5 Non-Text Items 5.4.6 Image Size 5.4.7 Valid Markup 5.4.8 Measures 5.4.9 Style Sheets 5.4.10 Minimize 5.4.11 Content Types 5.4.12 Character Encoding 5.4.13 Error Messages 5.4.14 Cookies 5.4.15 Cache Headers 5.4.16 Fonts 5.5.1 Input 5.5.2 Tab Order 5.5.3 Labels for Form Controls 5.1.1.1 What it means 5.1.2.1 What it means 5.1.3.1 What it means 5.1.4.1 What it means 5.1.4.2 How to do it 5.2.1.1 What it means 5.2.1.2 How to do it 5.2.2.1 What it means 5.2.2.2 How to do it 5.2.3.1 What it means 5.2.4.1 What it means 5.2.4.2 How to do it 5.2.4.3 References 5.2.5.1 What it means 5.2.5.2 What to test 5.2.5.3 References 5.2.6.1 What it means 5.2.6.2 How to do it 5.2.6.3 What to test 5.2.6.4 References 5.2.7.1 What it means 5.2.7.2 How to do it 5.2.7.3 What to test 5.2.7.4 References 5.2.8.1 What it means 5.2.8.2 What to test 5.2.8.3 References 5.2.9.1 What it means 5.2.9.2 How to do it 5.2.9.3 What to test 5.3.1.1 What it means 5.3.1.2 What to test 5.3.1.3 References 5.3.2.1 What it means 5.3.2.2 How to do it 5.3.2.3 What to test 5.3.2.4 References 5.3.3.1 What it means 5.3.3.2 How to do it 5.3.3.3 What to test 5.3.4.1 What it means 5.3.4.2 How to do it 5.3.4.3 What to test 5.3.4.4 References 5.3.5.1 What it means 5.3.5.2 What to test 5.3.6.1 What it means 5.3.6.2 What to test 5.3.6.3 References 5.3.7.1 What it means 5.3.7.2 What to test 5.4.1.1 What it means 5.4.1.2 What to test 5.4.2.1 What it means 5.4.2.2 What to test 5.4.2.3 References 5.4.3.1 What it means 5.4.3.2 How to do it 5.4.4.1 What it means 5.4.4.2 What to test 5.4.4.3 References 5.4.5.1 What it means 5.4.5.2 How to do it 5.4.5.3 What to test 5.4.5.4 References 5.4.6.1 What it means 5.4.6.2 What to test 5.4.7.1 What it means 5.4.7.2 What to test 5.4.7.3 References 5.4.8.1 What it means 5.4.8.2 How to do it 5.4.8.3 What to test 5.4.9.1 What it means 5.4.9.2 How to do it 5.4.9.3 What to test 5.4.9.4 References 5.4.10.1 What it means 5.4.10.2 How to do it 5.4.10.3 What to test 5.4.11.1 What it means 5.4.11.2 How to do it 5.4.11.3 What to test 5.4.12.1 What it means 5.4.12.3 What to test 5.4.12.4 References 5.4.13.1 What it means 5.4.13.2 How to do it 5.4.13.3 What to test 5.4.14.1 What it means 5.4.14.2 How to do it 5.4.14.3 What to test 5.4.15.1 What it means 5.4.15.2 How to do it 5.4.15.3 What to test 5.4.15.4 References 5.4.16.1 What it means 5.4.16.2 How to do it 5.4.16.3 What to test 5.5.1.1 What it means 5.5.1.2 How to do it 5.5.1.3 What to test 5.5.1.4 References 5.5.2.1 What it means 5.5.2.2 How to do it 5.5.2.3 What to test 5.5.3.1 What it means 5.5.3.2 What to test 5.5.3.3 References "http://www.example.org/index.html" "http://example.org" "http://www.example.org/example.html" "http://example.org/example" This version: Latest version: Previous version: Editors: Jo Rabin, mTLD Mobile Top Level Domain (dotMobi) Charles McCathieNevile, Opera Software [Early Drafts] 120 pixels, minimum.

This is in order to provide   guidance while leaving room to accommodate a wide variety of applications whose requirements cannot be anticipated. It also allows creativity and diversity within the same Best Practice framework. More prescriptive advice can be found in the Techniques document [Techniques].

This document specifies Best Practices for delivering Web content to mobile devices. The principal objective is to improve the user experience of the Web when accessed from such devices. The recommendations refer to delivered content and not to the processes by which it is created, nor to the devices or user agents to which it is delivered. It is primarily directed at creators, maintainers and operators of Web sites. Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with the creation of Web sites, and to have a general familiarity with the technologies involved, such as Web servers and HTTP. Readers are not expected to have a background in mobile-specific technologies. This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/. This document was developed by the Best Practices Working Group (BPWG) as part of the Mobile Web Initiative. Please see the Working Group's implementation report. Changes since the previous version of the document are editorial. A complete list of changes made to this document is available. Note the document stayed in Proposed Recommendation for more than a year as it depended on the progress of XHTML Basic 1.1 on the Recommendation track. Please send comments about this document to public-bpwg-comments@w3.org (with public archive). This document combines the experience of many mobile Web stakeholders into one set of best practices, regarded as essential by the participants of the Working Group. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy. This document is informative only. W3C maintains a  public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a  patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which  the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy. The following Best Practices are discussed in this document and listed here for convenience. There is also a free-standing summary.  This document sets out a series of recommendations designed to improve the user experience of the Web on mobile devices.  The recommendations are offered to creators, maintainers and operators of Web sites and are intended as the basis for assessing conformance to the mobileOK trustmark, which is described in the Mobile Web Best Practices Working Group Charter and is not developed in this  document.  At the time of writing of this document, documents describing mobileOK and techniques for implementing the Best Practice recommendations are being worked on. The document is organized as follows: Introduction. Describes the audience, purpose and scope of the document. Requirements. An illustration of the type of problems that the Best Practices are intended to ameliorate. Delivery Context.

Appendices Sources Related Reading Acknowledgements References Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with the creation of Web sites, and to have a general familiarity with the technologies involved, such as Web servers and HTTP. Readers are not expected to have a background in mobile-specific technologies. Our intention is to make it clear to all involved what the Best Practices are, and hence establish a common basis of understanding. As a result of wishing to be clear to those not already involved in the development of mobile friendly content, some of our statements may appear to be obvious or trivial to those with experience in this area. The document is not targeted solely at developers; others, such as interaction and graphic designers are encouraged to read it. The scope of these Best Practices is laid out in "Scope of Mobile Web Best Practices" [Scope]. In summary, this document refers primarily to the extension of Web browsing onto mobile devices. The Best Practice recommendations refer to delivered content. While they are clearly relevant to the processes of content creation and rendering on devices, they are not intended to be Best Practices for those activities. As the goal of the document is to specify Best Practices for delivery to mobile devices, statements that do not have a specific mobile aspect are not included. In particular, many Web Content Accessibility [WCAG] guidelines are general to all forms of Web access and are not repeated here unless they have a specific mobile interpretation. Examples of general good practice which have a specific mobile interpretation include "Error Messages" and "Color".  See B Related Reading for information about the related topics of Internationalization, Web Accessibility and Device Independence. As discussed in the Scope document [Scope] there are many  aspects to Mobile Web Best Practices. At present, for example, the design and construction of many Web sites and pages make for a poor user experience when they are viewed on a mobile device. The quality of the user's Web experience via a mobile device depends significantly on the usability of Web sites, of browsers, and of the device itself. Although browser usability  and device usability are important (for reading, navigating, and interacting with content), this document focuses primarily on Best Practices for improving site usability. In future phases other aspects may be considered - e.g. Best Practices as applied to  adaptation and devices. Also in future phases the scope of the recommendations may be extended beyond "Traditional Web Browsing" into fields such as multimodal interaction. These recommendations are in part derived from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG]. As noted above, WCAG guidelines are supplementary to the Mobile Web Best Practices, whose scope is limited to matters that have a specific mobile relevance. This document builds on some of the concepts described by the Device Independence Working  Group (DIWG) in the Device Independence Principles [DIP]. The document discusses device and delivery channel characteristics, which the DIWG has named "Delivery Context"  [DCODI]. In addition, the document uses some terminology from DIWG's Glossary of Terms for  Device Independence [DIGLOSS]. The BPWG is developing a companion document describing techniques [Techniques] by which the Best Practice statements in this document can be implemented. The Best Practices have been written at a level of generality that allows them to be applicable across a range of markup languages. They have been written with enduring properties of mobile access to the Web in mind. While the factors identified in 3.7 Default Delivery Context, such as screen dimensions, will change over time, it seems likely that the distinguishing features of mobile access such as cost and difficulty of input will remain issues. This document may be reviewed from time to time. When necessary, an updated version will be released with clear documentation as to the changes that have been introduced. This section discusses the requirements of the Mobile Web Best Practice statements in section 5. The statement of requirements is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive or complete. Today, Many Web pages are laid out for presentation on desktop size displays, and exploit capabilities of desktop browsing software. Accessing such a Web page on a mobile device often results in a poor or unusable experience. Contributing factors include pages not being laid out as intended. Because of the limited screen size and the limited amount of material that is visible to the user, context and overview are lost. Because of the limited screen size, the subject matter of the page may require considerable scrolling to be visible, especially if the top of the page is occupied by images and navigation links. In these cases the user gets no immediate feedback as to whether their retrieval has resulted in the right content. It is particularly important in the mobile context to help the user create a mental image of the site. This can be assisted by adopting a consistent style and can be considerably diminished by an uneven style. Mobile device input is often difficult when compared with use of a desktop device equipped with a keyboard. Mobile devices often have only a very limited keypad, with small keys, and there is frequently no pointing device. One of the difficulties of the mobile Web is that URIs are very difficult to type. Lengthy URIs and those that contain a lot of punctuation are particularly difficult to type correctly.  Because of the limitations of screen and input, forms are hard to fill in. This is because navigation between fields may not occur in the expected order and because of the difficulty in typing into the fields. While many modern devices provide back buttons, some do not, and in some cases, where back functionality exists, users may not know how to invoke it. This means that it is often very hard to recover from errors, broken links and so on. Mobile networks can be slow compared with fixed data connections and often have a measurably higher latency. This can lead to long retrieval times, especially for lengthy content and for content that requires a lot of navigation between pages. Mobile data transfer often costs money. The fact that mobile devices frequently support only limited types of content means that a user may follow a link and retrieve information that is unusable on their device. Even if the content type can be interpreted by their device there is often an issue with the experience not being satisfactory - for example, larger images may only be viewable in small pieces and require considerable scrolling. Web pages can contain content that the user has not specifically requested - especially advertising and large images. In the mobile world this extra material contributes to poor usability and may add considerably to the cost of the retrieval. Mobile users typically have different interests to users of fixed or desktop devices. They are likely to have more immediate and goal-directed intentions than desktop Web users. Their intentions are often to find out specific pieces of information that are relevant to their context. An example of such a goal-directed application might be the user requiring specific information about schedules for a journey they are currently undertaking. Equally, mobile users are typically less interested in lengthy documents or in browsing. The ergonomics of the device are frequently unsuitable for reading lengthy documents, and users will often only access such information from mobile devices as a last resort, because more convenient access is not available. Developers of commercial Web sites should note that different commercial models are often at work when the Web is accessed from mobile devices as compared with desktop devices. For example, some mechanisms that are commonly used for presentation of advertising material (such as pop-ups, pop-unders and large banners) do not work well on small devices and are therefore contrary to Best Practice recommendations such as [CENTRAL_MEANING], [LARGE_GRAPHICS] and [POP_UPS]. It is not the intention of the MWI to limit or to restrict advertising; rather it is the intention that the user experience of the site as a whole, including advertising, if any, is as effective as possible. As noted above, the restrictions imposed by the keyboard and the screen typically require a different approach to page design than for desktop devices. As detailed in the Scope document [Scope], various other limitations may apply and these have an impact on the usability of the Web from a mobile device. Mobile browsers often do not support scripting or plug-ins, which means that the range of content that they support is limited. In many cases the user has no choice of browser and upgrading it is not possible. Some activities associated with rendering Web pages are computationally intensive - for example re-flowing pages, laying out tables, processing unnecessarily long and complex style sheets and handling invalid markup [T-MOB]. Mobile devices typically have quite limited processing power which means that page rendering may take a noticeable time to complete. As well as introducing a noticeable delay, such processing uses more power as does communication with the server. Many devices have limited memory available for pages and images, and exceeding their memory limitations results in incomplete display and can cause other problems. In discussing the limitations of mobile devices for delivery of Web content it is easy to lose sight of the fact that they are extremely popular and very common. This popularity largely stems at present from them being: personal personalizable portable connected and increasingly multi-functional beyond their original purpose of voice communications. In addition to these factors, the advantages of mobile devices will increasingly include: location awareness one-handed operation always on universal alerting device By way of illustration of some of these factors: the Web can go where you go. You do not have to remember to do something on the Web when you get back to your computer. You can do it immediately, within the context that made you want to use the Web in the first place. Moreover, with mobile devices appearing in all shapes and forms, and  with a growing variety of features like location technology, cameras, voice recognition, touch screens etc, the Web can reach a much wider audience, and at all times in all situations. It has the opportunity to reach into places where wires cannot go, to places previously unthinkable (e.g. providing medical info to mountain rescue scenes) and to accompany everyone as easily as they carry the time on their wristwatches. Finally, today, many more people have access to mobile devices than access to a desktop computer. This is likely to be very significant in developing countries, where Web-capable mobile devices may play as similar a role in deploying wide-spread Web access as the mobile phone has played for providing "plain old telephone service". The recommendations in this document are intended to improve the experience of the Web on mobile devices. While the recommendations are not specifically addressed at the desktop browsing experience, it must be understood that they are made in the context of wishing to work towards "One Web".  As discussed in the Scope document [Scope], One Web means making, as far as is reasonable, the same information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are using. However, it does not mean that exactly the same information is available in exactly the same representation across all devices. The context of mobile use, device capability variations, bandwidth issues and mobile network capabilities all affect the representation. Furthermore, some services and information are more suitable for and targeted at particular user contexts (see 5.1.1 Thematic Consistency of Resource Identified by a URI). Some services have a primarily mobile appeal (location based services, for example). Some have a primarily mobile appeal but have a complementary desktop aspect (for instance for complex configuration tasks). Still others have a primarily desktop appeal but a complementary mobile aspect (possibly for alerting). Finally there will remain some Web applications that have a primarily desktop appeal (lengthy reference material, rich images, for example). It is likely that application designers and service providers will wish to provide the best possible experience in the context in which their service has the most appeal. However, while services may be most appropriately experienced in one context or another, it is considered best practice to provide as reasonable experience as is possible given device limitations and not to exclude access from any particular class of device, except where this is necessary because of device limitations. From the perspective of this document this means that services should be available as some variant of HTML over HTTP (see 3.7 Default Delivery Context). The widely varying characteristics of mobile devices can make it difficult for a Web site to provide an acceptable user experience across a significant range of devices. For example different devices support different markup features and different screen sizes may demand different sized images. Consequently, it is very common when delivering content to mobile devices to vary the details of the markup, format of images, image sizes, color depths and so on to suit the characteristics of the device in question. The process of altering content to enhance the user experience on particular devices is referred to as Content Adaptation. We do not describe adaptation in detail in this document. For a more detailed description, readers are referred to the Device Independence Principles [DIP]. In addition, the sister group of the Best Practices Working Group, the Device Description Working Group, is currently defining requirements for a repository of mobile device characteristics that are relevant to content adaptation. There are a number of different implementation models for content adaptation. On the one hand, adaptation may be quite simple and consist of determining the device type and choosing the most appropriate set of previously prepared content to match the device characteristics. At the other extreme it may be carried out in a completely dynamic way, with content formatted at the time of retrieval, taking into account not only statically determined properties, such as screen dimension, but also dynamically determined properties, such as the temporary attachment of a fully featured keyboard.  Adaptation can be carried out in a number of different points in the delivery of content to the device [DCODI]: Whatever the adaptation model at work, the process of adaptation should not diminish accessibility. In phase 1 (See 1.4.1 Phasing) it is assumed that content adaptation, if any, is carried out Server Side. Future phases may consider the implications of content adaptation elsewhere, especially the issues concerning the granting of authority to third parties to carry out adaptation, prohibiting adaptation and so on. Later phases may also address multiple adaptation - i.e. the possibility that adaptation can be applied at more than one point and that In-Network adaptation may occur more than once. It is also assumed that it is possible to create a site that is consistent with the Best Practice recommendations without carrying out adaptation at all. However it is likely that a more sophisticated and enhanced user experience will be achieved if adaptation is used. Providing variations on the user experience that are appropriate in different cases requires the content provider to know a significant amount about the characteristics of the device, the properties of the browser in use and the transparency of the network connection to the device. For simple sites that present an interface which is similar across a broad range of contexts the need for such information is diminished when compared with a sophisticated site that has an optimized navigation structure, presents different size images or carries out other adaptations to suit the particular delivery context. There are several methods by which a content provider can discover information about the delivery context, such as  CC/PP, UAPROF, CSS Media Queries and various outputs of the Device Independence Working Group. The companion Techniques [Techniques] document describes these methods. In the interests of "One Web" (see 3.1 One Web) considerations, the content provider may choose to allow the user to select from broad categories such as mobile or desktop presentation, where these are distinguished in the application. If the presentation option has been determined automatically, the content provider may choose to allow the user to override the automatic determination. Where a choice of presentations is available, it is good practice to record the user's preferences and to allow them to be changed. Given an appropriate server environment, it is unlikely that the content provider will be unable to find out anything about the delivery context. However this can happen, either because details of the delivery context are not available in sufficient detail or because the server does not provide the ability to inspect and act on the information provided. In this case a "reasonable default experience" should be provided. The details of the default experience depend upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the geographic region in which the service is offered and the primary intention of the service (e.g. considering whether the service is primarily desktop focused vs. primarily mobile focused). In order to allow content providers to share a consistent view of a default mobile experience the BPWG has defined the Default Delivery Context. This allows providers to create appropriate experiences in the absence of adaptation and provides a baseline experience where adaptation is used. The Default Delivery Context has been determined by the BPWG as being the minimum delivery context specification necessary for a reasonable experience of the Web. It is recognized that devices that do not meet this specification can provide a reasonable experience of other non-Web services. It is also recognized that this specification is made against the background of demographic, cultural and economic assumptions. Content providers may choose to provide services that demand a different or lower delivery context specification, but should try to provide an experience that exploits the capabilities of the Default Delivery Context in order to provide the best possible experience for that context. It is stressed that many devices exceed the capabilities defined by the DDC. Content providers are encouraged not to diminish the user experience on those devices by developing only to the DDC specification, and are encouraged to adapt their content, where appropriate, to exploit the capabilities of the actual device. In summary, the purpose of defining the DDC is to support the following rules: If an adaptation process is used, then information that is known about the actual Delivery Context should (see 5.1.2 Exploit Device Capabilities) be used to vary the delivered content to make it more suitable for that specific Delivery Context or to provide an enhanced user experience. If the delivered content does not result from an adaptation process - e.g. the content is statically defined as HTML stored in files, or the details of the Delivery Context cannot adequately be determined, then the delivered content should be suitable for the Default Delivery Context and should comply with the Best Practice statements. The Default Delivery Context is defined as follows: 120 pixels, minimum. XHTML Basic 1.1 [XHTML-Basic] delivered with content type application/xhtml+xml. UTF-8 [UTF-8]. JPEG. GIF 89a. 20 kilobytes. 256 Colors, minimum. CSS Level 1 [CSS]. In addition, CSS Level 2 [CSS2] @media  rule together with the handheld and all media types (see CSS 2 Media Types). HTTP/1.0 [HTTP1.0] or more recent [HTTP1.1]. No support for client side scripting. The functional area that is addressed by the statements. One or more Best Practice statements, identified in the following way: An explanation of the significance of the statements under this heading.  A discussion of techniques and some suggestions as to how to implement. The BPWG is creating a separate document describing techniques [Techniques] in more detail. The aspects of the delivered content that an external validator could examine to assess conformance with the Best Practice statements. This section is not present for process related statements. In this section it is noted whether the statement is Machine Testable (Automated testing is possible) or Human Testable (Testing requires human assessment). Some Best Practices are partially machine testable, i.e. based on the result of an automated test, some human interaction may be required. In such cases both a Machine Testable and a Human Testable statement are present. Some Best Practice statements use words such as "minimize" and "avoid" which are intentionally non-prescriptive. This is in order to provide   guidance while leaving room to accommodate a wide variety of applications whose requirements cannot be anticipated. It also allows creativity and diversity within the same Best Practice framework. More prescriptive advice can be found in the Techniques document [Techniques]. Where appropriate, references to related WCAG points and other immediate references from the preceding text. The Best Practice statements are grouped under the following headings There are some general principles that underlie delivery to mobile devices.  A bookmark captured on one device should be usable on another, different type of device even if it does not yield exactly the same experience. If the page that was bookmarked is not appropriate for the device that is now using it,  an alternative that is suitable should be provided.  Just as in the desktop world, there are browsers that do not respect the intentions of the content provider. There are differences in interpretation between browsers and there are also deficiencies in implementation. By deficient we mean non-support of mandatory features of a relevant standard or recommendation and other bugs or errors in implementation.  Just as it is not the intention to recommend a least common denominator approach, neither is it the intention to recommend avoiding features that exhibit problems on some class of devices. It is also not the intention to suggest that content providers should restrict their support to certain device types. Content providers should aim to support as wide a range of device types as is practical. Any Web site should be tested in a range of browsers. Mobile browsers often show markedly different characteristics to desktop browsers. As well as assessing a site's suitability for display in reduced format, content providers are encouraged to test that the features they rely on work in actual devices.  Content providers should also test with specific features disabled, such as using text-only modes and with scripting disabled. Many manufacturers provide emulators for their device that can provide a convenient preliminary means of testing. However, in practice, many of the emulators behave in a different way to the devices they emulate. Consequently testing should be carried out in as wide a range of real devices and specific software versions as is practical. Because of the limitations in display and of input mechanisms, the possible absence of a pointing device and other constraints of mobile devices, care should be exercised in defining the structure and the navigation model of a Web site. allow and instead of  allow Provide the basic links on a single line.  The design should aim to provide a balance between having a large number of navigation links on a page and the need to navigate multiple links to reach content. Using the same navigation mechanisms across a service helps users orient themselves and allows them to identify navigation mechanisms more easily. At each target of the drill-down navigation an "up" link should be provided to allow the user to jump up an entire section. This relates to WCAG 13.4. Where there is no pointing device, assigning an access key (keyboard short cut) to a link can provide a convenient way for users to access the link and avoid navigating to the link by repeated pressing of the navigation key. Machine Test: Test for the presence of the accesskey attribute. This relates to WCAG 9.5. Users of mobile devices may suffer undue delay and cost as a result of following links. It is important to identify where a link leads so users can make an assessment of whether following it will be of interest to them. While it is unlikely that the cost in monetary terms of a particular user following a particular link can be specified, it should be possible to give an idea of the size of the resource (in bytes or in an abstract way, e.g. large file). Links to content that is in a different format or different language to that of the page the link is on (i.e. content that can only be interpreted by other applications or downloads) should be human signposted, so that users are not lead to download content that their device may not be able to use. However, bear in mind that some devices support the rendering of those formats by other applications once downloaded (e.g. music files). Additionally, users may wish to download content for later transfer to other devices altogether. So even if it is known that the user agent does not support a particular content type, that content should still be made available. For the Default Delivery Context all formats other than XHTML, GIF and JPG should be noted.  Human Test: Check for proper descriptions (e.g. no use of "Click here"). Machine Test: Check for links to non-HTML formats. Human Test: If present check whether there is information about the format of the target of the link. This relates to WCAG 11.3 and 13.1. Many mobile devices lack a pointing device and server-side image maps cannot be used on such devices. For the Default Delivery Context, or if a satisfactory image map cannot be displayed, use a list of links with descriptive text instead. IMAGE_MAPS Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that does not support client-side image maps and check the map element is not present. This relates to WCAG 1.2 and 9.1. Each of these activities is likely to cause the user confusion, or add cost and delay to their interaction. Some mobile devices use a separate window for input; this section does not refer to such windows. Many mobile devices cannot support more than one window and consequently, attempting to open one will have unpredictable results. While redirection is a commonly employed mechanism, it must be remembered that redirection usually requires a round-trip to the browser. This adds to delay on slow links; so use a maximum of one redirect per page and limit the number of pages that are redirected. POP_UPS Machine Test: Look for the target attribute on links and if present check to see if it has a value different from _self, _parent or _top. AUTO_REFRESH  Machine Test: Check whether meta http-equiv="refresh" content="&lt;the same URI&gt;" is used. REDIRECTION Machine Test: Check whether meta http-equiv="refresh" content="&lt;a different URI&gt;" is used. This relates to WCAG 7.4, 7.5 and 10.1. Each linked resource (images, style sheets and other objects) requires a separate request across the network. This may add significantly to the load time of the page in the mobile context. Minimize the number of images on a page and consolidate style information into a single sheet per page (see also 5.4.9 Style Sheets). Machine Test: Count the number of linked images, style sheets and other linked items. Human Test: Review whether a similar effect could be obtained using fewer links. Users in a mobile context are often looking for specific pieces of information, rather than browsing. Content providers should consider the likely context of use of information and, while providing the option to access all information, should offer appropriate information first. See also discussion under 2.4 User Goals and 3.1 One Web. The general prescription to use clear language is of particular importance for mobile delivery, where brevity and directness are generally more desirable than a discursive style. Writing content in the traditional journalistic "front loaded" style can assist users determining whether information is of interest to them and allow them to skip it more easily if it is not. Placing distinguishing information at the beginning of headings,  paragraphs, lists, etc. can also help the user contextualize when using devices with limited screen area. See also 5.3.4 Navigation Bars etc. (Extraneous material) for a discussion of making sure that the subject matter of the page is near the top. Mobile users often pay for bandwidth, so offering them content that is extraneous to their needs, especially advertising, costs them time and money and contributes to an unsatisfactory experience.  In general, the user's consent should be sought before initiating the download of content. Human Test: Examine content to determine if, given the subject matter, it is appropriate in a mobile context. This relates to WCAG 13.8 and 14.1. If pages are too big they may take an unduly long time to load. In addition, mobile devices typically have restrictions on the largest page they can accommodate. On the other hand, if pages are too short then the user will be required to make multiple requests to read the relevant information. This can lead to an unnecessary delay, since each request typically takes a measurable time to complete. The balance between pagination and scrolling is partly a matter of taste and partly a matter of necessity. Devices with severe memory restrictions can only have small pages delivered to them. Equally some devices offer a poor scrolling experience and a better page retrieval experience. Some studies [MF] have been carried out in this area to test for user preferences. Some of these indicate that users prefer scrolling to click-throughs and some indicate the contrary. More research is likely to be needed in this area.   For the Default Delivery Context assume the limits specified in 3.7 Default Delivery Context.  PAGE_SIZE_USABLE Machine Test: Measure the total size of the markup for a page; check that it does not exceed 10 kilobytes for the Default Delivery Context. Human Test: Check that the page is still usable (e.g. not cut in the middle of a sentence, just before the end of a section, and so on). PAGE_SIZE_LIMIT Machine Test: Measure the total size of markup and images for a page; check that it does not go over the allowed size for the device - 20 kilobytes for the Default Delivery Context. This relates to WCAG 12.3. The page should lay out so that simple repeated scrolling in the same direction (axis) allows the user to experience all its content. However some content (such as maps and other images) cannot be displayed without secondary scrolling.  If some element on the page requires secondary scrolling it must not cause the remainder of the page to require this. For example, if an object causes subsequent text to lay out with a significant margin to its left, then this text may not be visible once a user has scrolled past the object. Equally, if the presence of such an object causes text to render beyond the right boundary of the page then the user will be required to scroll to read each line of text. If it is not possible to avoid presenting images that are larger than the screen size, then consider providing these images on a separate page with a link back to the main content. In the Default Delivery Context assume a width of 120 pixels. SCROLLING Machine Test: Check for width attributes and width style properties wider than the screen size - for the Default Delivery Context, 120 pixels. Human Test: If it is wider than the screen size, check that the use case warrants it (e.g. maps). Browse URIs within a site with a mobile device and observe that on pages with elements that require secondary scrolling only those elements require it, and the rest of the page requires only primary scrolling. Many Web pages are designed with significant navigational and other elements at the top of or to the side of the page (e.g. Menu Bars, Breadcrumb Trails and Search Functions). This provides a convenient and well-understood navigational metaphor on large displays. However, on small displays this can result in the navigation appearing instead of the actual content of the page when the page is first retrieved.  Because it is important for the user to gain an idea of the content of the page on initial view, there should be a minimum amount of clutter preceding this - including navigation, decorative images, advertising and other material that is not central to the user's experience of the page. The user should not have to scroll significantly to find the primary content of the page. See also 5.3.1 Page Content for a discussion of how writing style can help the user identify meaning. Human test: Browse URIs within a site with a mobile device and observe that the most important/relevant information is conveyed first. This relates to WCAG 13.5. The popular mechanism of using a 1 pixel graphic for absolute positioning does not work on a variety of screens. GRAPHICS_FOR_SPACING Machine Test: Check for very small and/or transparent graphics. LARGE_GRAPHICS  Machine Test: Check dimensions of graphics. Mobile devices often do not have good color contrast and are often used in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. Hence information highlighted in color may not be visible to users. If color is used to indicate a feature then that feature should generally also be indicated in a way that is not color dependent. In particular, do not use blue or purple text, as this may be confused with hyperlinks, especially on devices that do not underline links. USE_OF_COLOR  Human Test: Browse the page in a monochrome environment. COLOR_CONTRAST Human Test: Browse the page under a strong light parallel to the screen. Machine Test: There are automatic tools to test color contrast. This relates to WCAG 2.1 and 2.2. Images that are used indiscriminately can lead to content that is hard to view, particularly with the limited contrast often found on mobile devices and in the hostile viewing conditions in which mobile devices are frequently used. Before using background images, consider carefully your objectives for doing so and try to use alternative techniques to achieve similar objectives. If you use a background image ensure that the content is readable with and without the background image for devices that do not support them. Machine Test: Test for the presence of a background image. Human Test: Test readability both on devices that support them and devices that do not. Provide a descriptive title for the page to allow easy identification. Keep the title short to reduce page weight, and bear in mind that it may be truncated. Many mobile browsers do not display the title of a page. Where the title is displayed the available space may be limited. The device may use the page title as the default label for bookmarks. Again, space may be limited, so use it to help identify the content and not for other purposes. Machine Test: Test for presence of the title element. Human Test: Test that the title is descriptive of content. Many mobile devices do not support frames. In addition, frames are recognized as being generally problematic.  Machine Test: Test for presence of frame related elements -  check for frameset and iframe elements. See  http://www.w3.org/TR/xframes/#s_intro for a discussion of problems with frames. It is good practice for all but the simplest documents to indicate their structure through headings and sub-headings. Using structural markup, rather than formatting effects, allows easier adaptation of content where it needs to be divided into several pages, as well as potentially facilitating access to the sections of the document that a user is interested in. Where headings are used they should be used in accordance with the specification, i.e. they should be properly nested according to their level. Structural markup must not be used solely to create a font effect (see also 5.4.3 Structural Elements). Markup languages like HMTL contain many constructs to indicate structure. Tables do not work well on limited size screens and may result in the user having to scroll horizontally to read them. Putting navigational links into tables may result in the user having both to scroll horizontally and vertically to see possible navigational choices. TABLES_SUPPORT Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that does not support tables and check the table element is not present. Machine Test: Check that there are no nested tables. TABLES_LAYOUT Machine Test: Check that no column or row in a table is empty or contains only a 1x1 transparent GIF. Machine Test: If there is a table element, check to see whether there is rendered content outside the element. If there is not then it is likely that the table is being used for layout. This relates to WCAG 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5 and 5.6. A non-text item is defined by Non-text content in the WAI Glossary [WAIGlossary]. Downloading images to a mobiledevice adds to the time to display an image and the cost of displaying the page. Making the page readable in text-only mode can help the user assess its usefulness before images arrive. Many mobile devices do not support embedded objects or script and in many cases it is not possible for users to load plug-ins to add support. Content must be designed with this in mind.  Even where a device does support scripting, do not use it unless there is no other way of accomplishing your objectives. Scripting increases power consumption and so decreases battery life. Design pages so that they are useful when rendered as text-only. See also 5.1.4 Testing. Always use features of the markup designed to support alternate rendering such as the longdesc and alt attributes in XHTML. Use only features from the markup that are known to be supported by the device in question. Avoid things like CSS image replacement and pictures of words. If scripting is used, do not use onmouse and onkey triggers, use onclick. NON-TEXT_ALTERNATIVES Machine Test: Test for presence of alt attribute on images and text content on objects. Human Test: Check the relevance of the meaning of the content of alt attributes. OBJECTS_OR_SCRIPT Machine Test: Test for the presence of object or script elements in content delivered to a device that does not support them and if present carry out the Human Test below. Human Test: If present, test that the user experience is acceptable. This relates to WCAG 1.1, 3.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 and 9.2. Note that this recommendation contrasts with 5.4.8 Measures, which recommends using relative measures where possible. IMAGES_SPECIFY_SIZE Machine Test: Test for presence of width and height attributes on img elements. IMAGES_RESIZING  Machine Test: Check width and height attributes are equal to image dimensions. If the page markup is invalid this will result in unpredictable and possibly incomplete presentation.  Machine Test: Validate documents. This relates to WCAG 3.2, 11.1 and 11.2.  See http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/#validators.  Avoiding pixel and absolute measures allows the browser to adapt content to fit the display. An exception to rule is where an image has been specifically sized for a particular display (see 5.4.6 Image Size). In this case references to the image in markup may specify the exact dimensions of the image in pixels, in order to help the browser to flow the page and avoid re-flowing it after the page has been retrieved. Devices may realize the intentions of authors more accurately if margins, borders and padding are specified in pixels. Use percentage and relative measures such as em, ex, bolder, larger and thick. Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that supports relative measures correctly and check the values of font-size are not absolute or pixels. Style information may be contained in an externally linked style sheet or, in HTML, may be contained either in a style element or in a style attribute on specific elements. Mobile devices offer varying support for style sheets. Some provide full implementations, including caching of external style sheets; some do not cache external style sheets; some do not support the style element; some implementations do not support more than one style sheet and some do not support style sheets at all. If style sheets are turned off or not supported, content will be rendered in document order, so it is important that the content makes sense when read in document order. Optimize style information so that only styles that are used are included. When creating style sheets, take advantage of the CSS media types (these may be used both in the CSS @media rule and in the media attribute of the link element) to specify styles that apply to handheld rendering. The CSS Media types that apply are "handheld" and "all". If handheld rendering is not specified, browsers may download other style sheets even if they are identified as applicable to non-handheld rendering STYLE_SHEETS_USE Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that supports CSS and check that style sheets are used and that the page does not use formatting tags (e.g. font). STYLE_SHEETS_SUPPORT  Human Test: Disable style sheets and check that the page is still readable.  STYLE_SHEETS_SIZE Machine Test: Check that the elements in a style sheet are used in at least one of the pages that reference it. This relates to WCAG 3.3 and 6.1 Content which is marked up in languages such as XML can often be made smaller while preserving exactly the same semantics merely by removal of redundant white space (i.e. spaces and new lines). Marking fonts, colors and other stylistic effects in-line can cause considerably larger page sizes when compared with using logical markup, and use of the HTML class attribute for application of style (see also 5.4.9 Style Sheets). If "pretty printing" is an important part of the authoring process, then try to arrange that redundant white space is stripped when serving a page. Use of structural markup (see 5.4.3 Structural Elements) contributes to minimizing the size of the markup on a page, as does centralizing the style descriptions using CSS [CSS]. Machine Test: Count the number of non-significant white space characters in the document. Transferring content that a device cannot display wastes users' time and money. A device may express a preference for formats. In this case it is good practice to respect the device's preference, as it may have a fuller implementation of those formats. There are problems with using any one approach to the exclusion of the others. Some issues that have been noted by the BPWG in this context are: Some devices do not supply accept headers; Some devices mis-state their capabilities; Some operator gateways supplement the accept headers to include formats that they adapt; User agent headers do not always uniquely identify the device; UAProf information may not be available or may be incomplete. CONTENT_FORMAT_SUPPORT Machine Test: Check MIME types of content with various devices. CONTENT_FORMAT_PREFERRED  Machine Test: Check MIME types of content with various devices and check that the preferred format is sent or that the format is compatible with the Default Delivery Context. As in the previous section, content should not be sent to a device if it can not use it. Machine Test: Check that the encoding is declared in some way and is supported. The content type may be declared in one or more of the following ways: The Content-Type HTTP header, the XML declaration for XML-based content, the CSS @charset rules for CSS, the Content-Type Meta element for HTML content. A "retry" link to attempt the relevant part of the transaction again (note that this may not be equivalent to a page "refresh"); Enter an extraneous URI, known not to represent an actual resource on the site, and check that a HTTP 404 error response is accompanied by a page whose markup is appropriate for the requesting device, or the default context. Cookies are frequently used to carry out session management, to identify users and to store user preferences. Many mobile devices do not implement cookies or offer only an incomplete implementation. In addition, some gateways strip cookies and others simulate cookies on behalf of mobile devices.  Test that cookies are supported by the device on its current access path. If they are not supported, use URI decoration for session management, being careful not to exceed the device's maximum length for such strings. Some gateways provide user identification without setting cookies.  Machine Test: Check that an alternative to cookies is used for session management when they are not available. Set expiry times in a way that is appropriate to your application. Consider using Cache-Control: public to allow sharing of pages between devices, Cache-Control: private to allow re-use but only by the requesting device and Cache-Control: nocache to prevent caching. Machine Test: Check for the presence of cache headers on the HTTP response. Mobile devices often have few fonts and limited support for font sizes and effects (bold, italic etc.) As a result of this, the use of font size, face or effect, for example to highlight an answer or a stressed word, may not achieve the desired effect. See also 5.4.3 Structural Elements. For the Default Delivery Context do not use font related styling. Machine Test: Check for the presence of font related styling in an environment that does not support it. Human Test: If present, ensure that the author's intentions remain clear. This section contains statements relating to user input. This is typically more restrictive on mobile devices than on desktop computers (and often a lot more restrictive). For example, mobile devices may lack pointing devices and often do not have a standard keyboard for text entry. Given the typical input limitations of a mobile device, the interface must as far as possible minimize user input. Where possible, use selection lists, radio buttons and other controls that do not require typing. Some markup languages allow the specification of an input mode, which is particularly useful in cases where user input is to be restricted, for example to numeric only. It is anticipated that XHTML-Basic [XHTML-Basic] will support this functionality in the future. There are a number of techniques available for this, including: Where possible use previous entries as defaults. Make it possible to select items using navigation keys and/or numeric input. AVOID_FREE_TEXT  Machine Test: Check whether input type="text" and textarea are used.  Human Test: If one of them is used, check whether it can be replaced by a pre-determined entry. PROVIDE_DEFAULTS  Machine Test: Check if there is a pre-selected value in controls (selected or checked attribute set).   Human Test: If not, check if there could be sensible pre-selection in the context (e.g. most common choice). DEFAULT_INPUT_MODE Machine Test: Send a request with a device known to support the inputmode attribute and if the response is in a language that supports this attribute, check that it is present on input type="text" and textarea elements. This relates to WCAG 10.4. It is important that as the user navigates through the page the various fields and objects are presented in a logical order, especially as many of them will not be visible at the same time as the focus item. Use document order to control layout and tab order. Machine Test: Check that there are no tabindex attributes or layout effects that affect the order of presentation.  If there are tabindex attributes check that all controls have a tab index and that they are used consistently. Human Test: If there are either tabindex attributes or layout effects that might affect the order of presentation, then check that the order is usable. This means use the label element in HTML, or its equivalent in other languages. Make sure that where the label goes is consistent and close to the form control so re-flowing or adapting the content intelligently will always recognize label controls and keep them together.  Machine Test: Check if the label element is used in forms.   Human Test: Check whether the labels are properly positioned with regard to the controls. This relates to WCAG 10.2 and 12.4.  The Best Practice statements are intended to be capable of  having conformance statements constructed around them in support of the mobileOK trustmark and for other purposes. Work on the mobileOK trustmark will develop specific recommended requirements for a trustmark, which will be based on some profile, or subset, of the  Statements in this document. All of the Best Practice statements have a fragment identifier to allow formal reference to them and allow the construction of compliance claims that refer to them.

Some Best Practices are partially machine testable, i.e. based on the result of an automated test, some human interaction may be required. In such cases both a Machine Testable and a Human Testable statement are present.Some Best Practice statements use words such as "minimize" and "avoid" which are intentionally non-prescriptive. This is in order to provide   guidance while leaving room to accommodate a wide variety of applications whose requirements cannot be anticipated. It also allows creativity and diversity within the same Best Practice framework. More prescriptive advice can be found in the Techniques document [Techniques].

This document specifies Best Practices for delivering Web content to mobile devices. The principal objective is to improve the user experience of the Web when accessed from such devices. The recommendations refer to delivered content and not to the processes by which it is created, nor to the devices or user agents to which it is delivered. It is primarily directed at creators, maintainers and operators of Web sites. Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with the creation of Web sites, and to have a general familiarity with the technologies involved, such as Web servers and HTTP. Readers are not expected to have a background in mobile-specific technologies. This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/. This document was developed by the Best Practices Working Group (BPWG) as part of the Mobile Web Initiative. Please see the Working Group's implementation report. Changes since the previous version of the document are editorial. A complete list of changes made to this document is available. Note the document stayed in Proposed Recommendation for more than a year as it depended on the progress of XHTML Basic 1.1 on the Recommendation track. Please send comments about this document to public-bpwg-comments@w3.org (with public archive). This document combines the experience of many mobile Web stakeholders into one set of best practices, regarded as essential by the participants of the Working Group. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy. This document is informative only. W3C maintains a  public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a  patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which  the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy. The following Best Practices are discussed in this document and listed here for convenience. There is also a free-standing summary.  This document sets out a series of recommendations designed to improve the user experience of the Web on mobile devices.  The recommendations are offered to creators, maintainers and operators of Web sites and are intended as the basis for assessing conformance to the mobileOK trustmark, which is described in the Mobile Web Best Practices Working Group Charter and is not developed in this  document.  At the time of writing of this document, documents describing mobileOK and techniques for implementing the Best Practice recommendations are being worked on. The document is organized as follows: Introduction. Describes the audience, purpose and scope of the document. Requirements. An illustration of the type of problems that the Best Practices are intended to ameliorate. Delivery Context. Discusses the environment within which mobile access to the Web is realized, with particular reference to adaptation. Overview of Best Practices. A discussion of the organization of the Best Practices, and sources from which they were derived. Best Practices. The statements themselves. Conformance and mobileOK. A brief conformance statement and reference to the mobileOK documentation. Appendices Sources Related Reading Acknowledgements References Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with the creation of Web sites, and to have a general familiarity with the technologies involved, such as Web servers and HTTP. Readers are not expected to have a background in mobile-specific technologies. Our intention is to make it clear to all involved what the Best Practices are, and hence establish a common basis of understanding. As a result of wishing to be clear to those not already involved in the development of mobile friendly content, some of our statements may appear to be obvious or trivial to those with experience in this area. The document is not targeted solely at developers; others, such as interaction and graphic designers are encouraged to read it. The scope of these Best Practices is laid out in "Scope of Mobile Web Best Practices" [Scope]. In summary, this document refers primarily to the extension of Web browsing onto mobile devices. The Best Practice recommendations refer to delivered content. While they are clearly relevant to the processes of content creation and rendering on devices, they are not intended to be Best Practices for those activities. As the goal of the document is to specify Best Practices for delivery to mobile devices, statements that do not have a specific mobile aspect are not included. In particular, many Web Content Accessibility [WCAG] guidelines are general to all forms of Web access and are not repeated here unless they have a specific mobile interpretation. Examples of general good practice which have a specific mobile interpretation include "Error Messages" and "Color".  See B Related Reading for information about the related topics of Internationalization, Web Accessibility and Device Independence. As discussed in the Scope document [Scope] there are many  aspects to Mobile Web Best Practices. At present, for example, the design and construction of many Web sites and pages make for a poor user experience when they are viewed on a mobile device. The quality of the user's Web experience via a mobile device depends significantly on the usability of Web sites, of browsers, and of the device itself. Although browser usability  and device usability are important (for reading, navigating, and interacting with content), this document focuses primarily on Best Practices for improving site usability. In future phases other aspects may be considered - e.g. Best Practices as applied to  adaptation and devices. Also in future phases the scope of the recommendations may be extended beyond "Traditional Web Browsing" into fields such as multimodal interaction. These recommendations are in part derived from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG]. As noted above, WCAG guidelines are supplementary to the Mobile Web Best Practices, whose scope is limited to matters that have a specific mobile relevance. This document builds on some of the concepts described by the Device Independence Working  Group (DIWG) in the Device Independence Principles [DIP]. The document discusses device and delivery channel characteristics, which the DIWG has named "Delivery Context"  [DCODI]. In addition, the document uses some terminology from DIWG's Glossary of Terms for  Device Independence [DIGLOSS]. The BPWG is developing a companion document describing techniques [Techniques] by which the Best Practice statements in this document can be implemented. The Best Practices have been written at a level of generality that allows them to be applicable across a range of markup languages. They have been written with enduring properties of mobile access to the Web in mind. While the factors identified in 3.7 Default Delivery Context, such as screen dimensions, will change over time, it seems likely that the distinguishing features of mobile access such as cost and difficulty of input will remain issues. This document may be reviewed from time to time. When necessary, an updated version will be released with clear documentation as to the changes that have been introduced. This section discusses the requirements of the Mobile Web Best Practice statements in section 5. The statement of requirements is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive or complete. Today, Many Web pages are laid out for presentation on desktop size displays, and exploit capabilities of desktop browsing software. Accessing such a Web page on a mobile device often results in a poor or unusable experience. Contributing factors include pages not being laid out as intended. Because of the limited screen size and the limited amount of material that is visible to the user, context and overview are lost. Because of the limited screen size, the subject matter of the page may require considerable scrolling to be visible, especially if the top of the page is occupied by images and navigation links. In these cases the user gets no immediate feedback as to whether their retrieval has resulted in the right content. It is particularly important in the mobile context to help the user create a mental image of the site. This can be assisted by adopting a consistent style and can be considerably diminished by an uneven style. Mobile device input is often difficult when compared with use of a desktop device equipped with a keyboard. Mobile devices often have only a very limited keypad, with small keys, and there is frequently no pointing device. One of the difficulties of the mobile Web is that URIs are very difficult to type. Lengthy URIs and those that contain a lot of punctuation are particularly difficult to type correctly.  Because of the limitations of screen and input, forms are hard to fill in. This is because navigation between fields may not occur in the expected order and because of the difficulty in typing into the fields. While many modern devices provide back buttons, some do not, and in some cases, where back functionality exists, users may not know how to invoke it. This means that it is often very hard to recover from errors, broken links and so on. Mobile networks can be slow compared with fixed data connections and often have a measurably higher latency. This can lead to long retrieval times, especially for lengthy content and for content that requires a lot of navigation between pages. Mobile data transfer often costs money. The fact that mobile devices frequently support only limited types of content means that a user may follow a link and retrieve information that is unusable on their device. Even if the content type can be interpreted by their device there is often an issue with the experience not being satisfactory - for example, larger images may only be viewable in small pieces and require considerable scrolling. Web pages can contain content that the user has not specifically requested - especially advertising and large images. In the mobile world this extra material contributes to poor usability and may add considerably to the cost of the retrieval. Mobile users typically have different interests to users of fixed or desktop devices. They are likely to have more immediate and goal-directed intentions than desktop Web users. Their intentions are often to find out specific pieces of information that are relevant to their context. An example of such a goal-directed application might be the user requiring specific information about schedules for a journey they are currently undertaking. Equally, mobile users are typically less interested in lengthy documents or in browsing. The ergonomics of the device are frequently unsuitable for reading lengthy documents, and users will often only access such information from mobile devices as a last resort, because more convenient access is not available. Developers of commercial Web sites should note that different commercial models are often at work when the Web is accessed from mobile devices as compared with desktop devices. For example, some mechanisms that are commonly used for presentation of advertising material (such as pop-ups, pop-unders and large banners) do not work well on small devices and are therefore contrary to Best Practice recommendations such as [CENTRAL_MEANING], [LARGE_GRAPHICS] and [POP_UPS]. It is not the intention of the MWI to limit or to restrict advertising; rather it is the intention that the user experience of the site as a whole, including advertising, if any, is as effective as possible. As noted above, the restrictions imposed by the keyboard and the screen typically require a different approach to page design than for desktop devices. As detailed in the Scope document [Scope], various other limitations may apply and these have an impact on the usability of the Web from a mobile device. Mobile browsers often do not support scripting or plug-ins, which means that the range of content that they support is limited. In many cases the user has no choice of browser and upgrading it is not possible. Some activities associated with rendering Web pages are computationally intensive - for example re-flowing pages, laying out tables, processing unnecessarily long and complex style sheets and handling invalid markup [T-MOB]. Mobile devices typically have quite limited processing power which means that page rendering may take a noticeable time to complete. As well as introducing a noticeable delay, such processing uses more power as does communication with the server. Many devices have limited memory available for pages and images, and exceeding their memory limitations results in incomplete display and can cause other problems. In discussing the limitations of mobile devices for delivery of Web content it is easy to lose sight of the fact that they are extremely popular and very common. This popularity largely stems at present from them being: personal personalizable portable connected and increasingly multi-functional beyond their original purpose of voice communications. In addition to these factors, the advantages of mobile devices will increasingly include: location awareness one-handed operation always on universal alerting device By way of illustration of some of these factors: the Web can go where you go. You do not have to remember to do something on the Web when you get back to your computer. You can do it immediately, within the context that made you want to use the Web in the first place. Moreover, with mobile devices appearing in all shapes and forms, and  with a growing variety of features like location technology, cameras, voice recognition, touch screens etc, the Web can reach a much wider audience, and at all times in all situations. It has the opportunity to reach into places where wires cannot go, to places previously unthinkable (e.g. providing medical info to mountain rescue scenes) and to accompany everyone as easily as they carry the time on their wristwatches. Finally, today, many more people have access to mobile devices than access to a desktop computer. This is likely to be very significant in developing countries, where Web-capable mobile devices may play as similar a role in deploying wide-spread Web access as the mobile phone has played for providing "plain old telephone service". The recommendations in this document are intended to improve the experience of the Web on mobile devices. While the recommendations are not specifically addressed at the desktop browsing experience, it must be understood that they are made in the context of wishing to work towards "One Web".  As discussed in the Scope document [Scope], One Web means making, as far as is reasonable, the same information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are using. However, it does not mean that exactly the same information is available in exactly the same representation across all devices. The context of mobile use, device capability variations, bandwidth issues and mobile network capabilities all affect the representation. Furthermore, some services and information are more suitable for and targeted at particular user contexts (see 5.1.1 Thematic Consistency of Resource Identified by a URI). Some services have a primarily mobile appeal (location based services, for example). Some have a primarily mobile appeal but have a complementary desktop aspect (for instance for complex configuration tasks). Still others have a primarily desktop appeal but a complementary mobile aspect (possibly for alerting). Finally there will remain some Web applications that have a primarily desktop appeal (lengthy reference material, rich images, for example). It is likely that application designers and service providers will wish to provide the best possible experience in the context in which their service has the most appeal. However, while services may be most appropriately experienced in one context or another, it is considered best practice to provide as reasonable experience as is possible given device limitations and not to exclude access from any particular class of device, except where this is necessary because of device limitations. From the perspective of this document this means that services should be available as some variant of HTML over HTTP (see 3.7 Default Delivery Context). The widely varying characteristics of mobile devices can make it difficult for a Web site to provide an acceptable user experience across a significant range of devices. For example different devices support different markup features and different screen sizes may demand different sized images. Consequently, it is very common when delivering content to mobile devices to vary the details of the markup, format of images, image sizes, color depths and so on to suit the characteristics of the device in question. The process of altering content to enhance the user experience on particular devices is referred to as Content Adaptation. We do not describe adaptation in detail in this document. For a more detailed description, readers are referred to the Device Independence Principles [DIP]. In addition, the sister group of the Best Practices Working Group, the Device Description Working Group, is currently defining requirements for a repository of mobile device characteristics that are relevant to content adaptation. There are a number of different implementation models for content adaptation. On the one hand, adaptation may be quite simple and consist of determining the device type and choosing the most appropriate set of previously prepared content to match the device characteristics. At the other extreme it may be carried out in a completely dynamic way, with content formatted at the time of retrieval, taking into account not only statically determined properties, such as screen dimension, but also dynamically determined properties, such as the temporary attachment of a fully featured keyboard.  Adaptation can be carried out in a number of different points in the delivery of content to the device [DCODI]: Whatever the adaptation model at work, the process of adaptation should not diminish accessibility. In phase 1 (See 1.4.1 Phasing) it is assumed that content adaptation, if any, is carried out Server Side. Future phases may consider the implications of content adaptation elsewhere, especially the issues concerning the granting of authority to third parties to carry out adaptation, prohibiting adaptation and so on. Later phases may also address multiple adaptation - i.e. the possibility that adaptation can be applied at more than one point and that In-Network adaptation may occur more than once. It is also assumed that it is possible to create a site that is consistent with the Best Practice recommendations without carrying out adaptation at all. However it is likely that a more sophisticated and enhanced user experience will be achieved if adaptation is used. Providing variations on the user experience that are appropriate in different cases requires the content provider to know a significant amount about the characteristics of the device, the properties of the browser in use and the transparency of the network connection to the device. For simple sites that present an interface which is similar across a broad range of contexts the need for such information is diminished when compared with a sophisticated site that has an optimized navigation structure, presents different size images or carries out other adaptations to suit the particular delivery context. There are several methods by which a content provider can discover information about the delivery context, such as  CC/PP, UAPROF, CSS Media Queries and various outputs of the Device Independence Working Group. The companion Techniques [Techniques] document describes these methods. In the interests of "One Web" (see 3.1 One Web) considerations, the content provider may choose to allow the user to select from broad categories such as mobile or desktop presentation, where these are distinguished in the application. If the presentation option has been determined automatically, the content provider may choose to allow the user to override the automatic determination. Where a choice of presentations is available, it is good practice to record the user's preferences and to allow them to be changed. Given an appropriate server environment, it is unlikely that the content provider will be unable to find out anything about the delivery context. However this can happen, either because details of the delivery context are not available in sufficient detail or because the server does not provide the ability to inspect and act on the information provided. In this case a "reasonable default experience" should be provided. The details of the default experience depend upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the geographic region in which the service is offered and the primary intention of the service (e.g. considering whether the service is primarily desktop focused vs. primarily mobile focused). In order to allow content providers to share a consistent view of a default mobile experience the BPWG has defined the Default Delivery Context. This allows providers to create appropriate experiences in the absence of adaptation and provides a baseline experience where adaptation is used. The Default Delivery Context has been determined by the BPWG as being the minimum delivery context specification necessary for a reasonable experience of the Web. It is recognized that devices that do not meet this specification can provide a reasonable experience of other non-Web services. It is also recognized that this specification is made against the background of demographic, cultural and economic assumptions. Content providers may choose to provide services that demand a different or lower delivery context specification, but should try to provide an experience that exploits the capabilities of the Default Delivery Context in order to provide the best possible experience for that context. It is stressed that many devices exceed the capabilities defined by the DDC. Content providers are encouraged not to diminish the user experience on those devices by developing only to the DDC specification, and are encouraged to adapt their content, where appropriate, to exploit the capabilities of the actual device. In summary, the purpose of defining the DDC is to support the following rules: If an adaptation process is used, then information that is known about the actual Delivery Context should (see 5.1.2 Exploit Device Capabilities) be used to vary the delivered content to make it more suitable for that specific Delivery Context or to provide an enhanced user experience. If the delivered content does not result from an adaptation process - e.g. the content is statically defined as HTML stored in files, or the details of the Delivery Context cannot adequately be determined, then the delivered content should be suitable for the Default Delivery Context and should comply with the Best Practice statements. The Default Delivery Context is defined as follows: 120 pixels, minimum. XHTML Basic 1.1 [XHTML-Basic] delivered with content type application/xhtml+xml. UTF-8 [UTF-8]. JPEG. GIF 89a. 20 kilobytes. 256 Colors, minimum. CSS Level 1 [CSS]. In addition, CSS Level 2 [CSS2] @media  rule together with the handheld and all media types (see CSS 2 Media Types). HTTP/1.0 [HTTP1.0] or more recent [HTTP1.1]. No support for client side scripting. The functional area that is addressed by the statements. One or more Best Practice statements, identified in the following way: An explanation of the significance of the statements under this heading.  A discussion of techniques and some suggestions as to how to implement. The BPWG is creating a separate document describing techniques [Techniques] in more detail. The aspects of the delivered content that an external validator could examine to assess conformance with the Best Practice statements. This section is not present for process related statements. In this section it is noted whether the statement is Machine Testable (Automated testing is possible) or Human Testable (Testing requires human assessment). Some Best Practices are partially machine testable, i.e. based on the result of an automated test, some human interaction may be required. In such cases both a Machine Testable and a Human Testable statement are present. Some Best Practice statements use words such as "minimize" and "avoid" which are intentionally non-prescriptive. This is in order to provide   guidance while leaving room to accommodate a wide variety of applications whose requirements cannot be anticipated. It also allows creativity and diversity within the same Best Practice framework. More prescriptive advice can be found in the Techniques document [Techniques]. Where appropriate, references to related WCAG points and other immediate references from the preceding text. The Best Practice statements are grouped under the following headings There are some general principles that underlie delivery to mobile devices.  A bookmark captured on one device should be usable on another, different type of device even if it does not yield exactly the same experience. If the page that was bookmarked is not appropriate for the device that is now using it,  an alternative that is suitable should be provided.  Just as in the desktop world, there are browsers that do not respect the intentions of the content provider. There are differences in interpretation between browsers and there are also deficiencies in implementation. By deficient we mean non-support of mandatory features of a relevant standard or recommendation and other bugs or errors in implementation.  Just as it is not the intention to recommend a least common denominator approach, neither is it the intention to recommend avoiding features that exhibit problems on some class of devices. It is also not the intention to suggest that content providers should restrict their support to certain device types. Content providers should aim to support as wide a range of device types as is practical. Any Web site should be tested in a range of browsers. Mobile browsers often show markedly different characteristics to desktop browsers. As well as assessing a site's suitability for display in reduced format, content providers are encouraged to test that the features they rely on work in actual devices.  Content providers should also test with specific features disabled, such as using text-only modes and with scripting disabled. Many manufacturers provide emulators for their device that can provide a convenient preliminary means of testing. However, in practice, many of the emulators behave in a different way to the devices they emulate. Consequently testing should be carried out in as wide a range of real devices and specific software versions as is practical. Because of the limitations in display and of input mechanisms, the possible absence of a pointing device and other constraints of mobile devices, care should be exercised in defining the structure and the navigation model of a Web site. allow and instead of  allow Provide the basic links on a single line.  The design should aim to provide a balance between having a large number of navigation links on a page and the need to navigate multiple links to reach content. Using the same navigation mechanisms across a service helps users orient themselves and allows them to identify navigation mechanisms more easily. At each target of the drill-down navigation an "up" link should be provided to allow the user to jump up an entire section. This relates to WCAG 13.4. Where there is no pointing device, assigning an access key (keyboard short cut) to a link can provide a convenient way for users to access the link and avoid navigating to the link by repeated pressing of the navigation key. Machine Test: Test for the presence of the accesskey attribute. This relates to WCAG 9.5. Users of mobile devices may suffer undue delay and cost as a result of following links. It is important to identify where a link leads so users can make an assessment of whether following it will be of interest to them. While it is unlikely that the cost in monetary terms of a particular user following a particular link can be specified, it should be possible to give an idea of the size of the resource (in bytes or in an abstract way, e.g. large file). Links to content that is in a different format or different language to that of the page the link is on (i.e. content that can only be interpreted by other applications or downloads) should be human signposted, so that users are not lead to download content that their device may not be able to use. However, bear in mind that some devices support the rendering of those formats by other applications once downloaded (e.g. music files). Additionally, users may wish to download content for later transfer to other devices altogether. So even if it is known that the user agent does not support a particular content type, that content should still be made available. For the Default Delivery Context all formats other than XHTML, GIF and JPG should be noted.  Human Test: Check for proper descriptions (e.g. no use of "Click here"). Machine Test: Check for links to non-HTML formats. Human Test: If present check whether there is information about the format of the target of the link. This relates to WCAG 11.3 and 13.1. Many mobile devices lack a pointing device and server-side image maps cannot be used on such devices. For the Default Delivery Context, or if a satisfactory image map cannot be displayed, use a list of links with descriptive text instead. IMAGE_MAPS Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that does not support client-side image maps and check the map element is not present. This relates to WCAG 1.2 and 9.1. Each of these activities is likely to cause the user confusion, or add cost and delay to their interaction. Some mobile devices use a separate window for input; this section does not refer to such windows. Many mobile devices cannot support more than one window and consequently, attempting to open one will have unpredictable results. While redirection is a commonly employed mechanism, it must be remembered that redirection usually requires a round-trip to the browser. This adds to delay on slow links; so use a maximum of one redirect per page and limit the number of pages that are redirected. POP_UPS Machine Test: Look for the target attribute on links and if present check to see if it has a value different from _self, _parent or _top. AUTO_REFRESH  Machine Test: Check whether meta http-equiv="refresh" content="&lt;the same URI&gt;" is used. REDIRECTION Machine Test: Check whether meta http-equiv="refresh" content="&lt;a different URI&gt;" is used. This relates to WCAG 7.4, 7.5 and 10.1. Each linked resource (images, style sheets and other objects) requires a separate request across the network. This may add significantly to the load time of the page in the mobile context. Minimize the number of images on a page and consolidate style information into a single sheet per page (see also 5.4.9 Style Sheets). Machine Test: Count the number of linked images, style sheets and other linked items. Human Test: Review whether a similar effect could be obtained using fewer links. Users in a mobile context are often looking for specific pieces of information, rather than browsing. Content providers should consider the likely context of use of information and, while providing the option to access all information, should offer appropriate information first. See also discussion under 2.4 User Goals and 3.1 One Web. The general prescription to use clear language is of particular importance for mobile delivery, where brevity and directness are generally more desirable than a discursive style. Writing content in the traditional journalistic "front loaded" style can assist users determining whether information is of interest to them and allow them to skip it more easily if it is not. Placing distinguishing information at the beginning of headings,  paragraphs, lists, etc. can also help the user contextualize when using devices with limited screen area. See also 5.3.4 Navigation Bars etc. (Extraneous material) for a discussion of making sure that the subject matter of the page is near the top. Mobile users often pay for bandwidth, so offering them content that is extraneous to their needs, especially advertising, costs them time and money and contributes to an unsatisfactory experience.  In general, the user's consent should be sought before initiating the download of content. Human Test: Examine content to determine if, given the subject matter, it is appropriate in a mobile context. This relates to WCAG 13.8 and 14.1. If pages are too big they may take an unduly long time to load. In addition, mobile devices typically have restrictions on the largest page they can accommodate. On the other hand, if pages are too short then the user will be required to make multiple requests to read the relevant information. This can lead to an unnecessary delay, since each request typically takes a measurable time to complete. The balance between pagination and scrolling is partly a matter of taste and partly a matter of necessity. Devices with severe memory restrictions can only have small pages delivered to them. Equally some devices offer a poor scrolling experience and a better page retrieval experience. Some studies [MF] have been carried out in this area to test for user preferences. Some of these indicate that users prefer scrolling to click-throughs and some indicate the contrary. More research is likely to be needed in this area.   For the Default Delivery Context assume the limits specified in 3.7 Default Delivery Context.  PAGE_SIZE_USABLE Machine Test: Measure the total size of the markup for a page; check that it does not exceed 10 kilobytes for the Default Delivery Context. Human Test: Check that the page is still usable (e.g. not cut in the middle of a sentence, just before the end of a section, and so on). PAGE_SIZE_LIMIT Machine Test: Measure the total size of markup and images for a page; check that it does not go over the allowed size for the device - 20 kilobytes for the Default Delivery Context. This relates to WCAG 12.3. The page should lay out so that simple repeated scrolling in the same direction (axis) allows the user to experience all its content. However some content (such as maps and other images) cannot be displayed without secondary scrolling.  If some element on the page requires secondary scrolling it must not cause the remainder of the page to require this. For example, if an object causes subsequent text to lay out with a significant margin to its left, then this text may not be visible once a user has scrolled past the object. Equally, if the presence of such an object causes text to render beyond the right boundary of the page then the user will be required to scroll to read each line of text. If it is not possible to avoid presenting images that are larger than the screen size, then consider providing these images on a separate page with a link back to the main content. In the Default Delivery Context assume a width of 120 pixels. SCROLLING Machine Test: Check for width attributes and width style properties wider than the screen size - for the Default Delivery Context, 120 pixels. Human Test: If it is wider than the screen size, check that the use case warrants it (e.g. maps). Browse URIs within a site with a mobile device and observe that on pages with elements that require secondary scrolling only those elements require it, and the rest of the page requires only primary scrolling. Many Web pages are designed with significant navigational and other elements at the top of or to the side of the page (e.g. Menu Bars, Breadcrumb Trails and Search Functions). This provides a convenient and well-understood navigational metaphor on large displays. However, on small displays this can result in the navigation appearing instead of the actual content of the page when the page is first retrieved.  Because it is important for the user to gain an idea of the content of the page on initial view, there should be a minimum amount of clutter preceding this - including navigation, decorative images, advertising and other material that is not central to the user's experience of the page. The user should not have to scroll significantly to find the primary content of the page. See also 5.3.1 Page Content for a discussion of how writing style can help the user identify meaning. Human test: Browse URIs within a site with a mobile device and observe that the most important/relevant information is conveyed first. This relates to WCAG 13.5. The popular mechanism of using a 1 pixel graphic for absolute positioning does not work on a variety of screens. GRAPHICS_FOR_SPACING Machine Test: Check for very small and/or transparent graphics. LARGE_GRAPHICS  Machine Test: Check dimensions of graphics. Mobile devices often do not have good color contrast and are often used in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. Hence information highlighted in color may not be visible to users. If color is used to indicate a feature then that feature should generally also be indicated in a way that is not color dependent. In particular, do not use blue or purple text, as this may be confused with hyperlinks, especially on devices that do not underline links. USE_OF_COLOR  Human Test: Browse the page in a monochrome environment. COLOR_CONTRAST Human Test: Browse the page under a strong light parallel to the screen. Machine Test: There are automatic tools to test color contrast. This relates to WCAG 2.1 and 2.2. Images that are used indiscriminately can lead to content that is hard to view, particularly with the limited contrast often found on mobile devices and in the hostile viewing conditions in which mobile devices are frequently used. Before using background images, consider carefully your objectives for doing so and try to use alternative techniques to achieve similar objectives. If you use a background image ensure that the content is readable with and without the background image for devices that do not support them. Machine Test: Test for the presence of a background image. Human Test: Test readability both on devices that support them and devices that do not. Provide a descriptive title for the page to allow easy identification. Keep the title short to reduce page weight, and bear in mind that it may be truncated. Many mobile browsers do not display the title of a page. Where the title is displayed the available space may be limited. The device may use the page title as the default label for bookmarks. Again, space may be limited, so use it to help identify the content and not for other purposes. Machine Test: Test for presence of the title element. Human Test: Test that the title is descriptive of content. Many mobile devices do not support frames. In addition, frames are recognized as being generally problematic.  Machine Test: Test for presence of frame related elements -  check for frameset and iframe elements. See  http://www.w3.org/TR/xframes/#s_intro for a discussion of problems with frames. It is good practice for all but the simplest documents to indicate their structure through headings and sub-headings. Using structural markup, rather than formatting effects, allows easier adaptation of content where it needs to be divided into several pages, as well as potentially facilitating access to the sections of the document that a user is interested in. Where headings are used they should be used in accordance with the specification, i.e. they should be properly nested according to their level. Structural markup must not be used solely to create a font effect (see also 5.4.3 Structural Elements). Markup languages like HMTL contain many constructs to indicate structure. Tables do not work well on limited size screens and may result in the user having to scroll horizontally to read them. Putting navigational links into tables may result in the user having both to scroll horizontally and vertically to see possible navigational choices. TABLES_SUPPORT Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that does not support tables and check the table element is not present. Machine Test: Check that there are no nested tables. TABLES_LAYOUT Machine Test: Check that no column or row in a table is empty or contains only a 1x1 transparent GIF. Machine Test: If there is a table element, check to see whether there is rendered content outside the element. If there is not then it is likely that the table is being used for layout. This relates to WCAG 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5 and 5.6. A non-text item is defined by Non-text content in the WAI Glossary [WAIGlossary]. Downloading images to a mobiledevice adds to the time to display an image and the cost of displaying the page. Making the page readable in text-only mode can help the user assess its usefulness before images arrive. Many mobile devices do not support embedded objects or script and in many cases it is not possible for users to load plug-ins to add support. Content must be designed with this in mind.  Even where a device does support scripting, do not use it unless there is no other way of accomplishing your objectives. Scripting increases power consumption and so decreases battery life. Design pages so that they are useful when rendered as text-only. See also 5.1.4 Testing. Always use features of the markup designed to support alternate rendering such as the longdesc and alt attributes in XHTML. Use only features from the markup that are known to be supported by the device in question. Avoid things like CSS image replacement and pictures of words. If scripting is used, do not use onmouse and onkey triggers, use onclick. NON-TEXT_ALTERNATIVES Machine Test: Test for presence of alt attribute on images and text content on objects. Human Test: Check the relevance of the meaning of the content of alt attributes. OBJECTS_OR_SCRIPT Machine Test: Test for the presence of object or script elements in content delivered to a device that does not support them and if present carry out the Human Test below. Human Test: If present, test that the user experience is acceptable. This relates to WCAG 1.1, 3.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 and 9.2. Note that this recommendation contrasts with 5.4.8 Measures, which recommends using relative measures where possible. IMAGES_SPECIFY_SIZE Machine Test: Test for presence of width and height attributes on img elements. IMAGES_RESIZING  Machine Test: Check width and height attributes are equal to image dimensions. If the page markup is invalid this will result in unpredictable and possibly incomplete presentation.  Machine Test: Validate documents. This relates to WCAG 3.2, 11.1 and 11.2.  See http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/#validators.  Avoiding pixel and absolute measures allows the browser to adapt content to fit the display. An exception to rule is where an image has been specifically sized for a particular display (see 5.4.6 Image Size). In this case references to the image in markup may specify the exact dimensions of the image in pixels, in order to help the browser to flow the page and avoid re-flowing it after the page has been retrieved. Devices may realize the intentions of authors more accurately if margins, borders and padding are specified in pixels. Use percentage and relative measures such as em, ex, bolder, larger and thick. Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that supports relative measures correctly and check the values of font-size are not absolute or pixels. Style information may be contained in an externally linked style sheet or, in HTML, may be contained either in a style element or in a style attribute on specific elements. Mobile devices offer varying support for style sheets. Some provide full implementations, including caching of external style sheets; some do not cache external style sheets; some do not support the style element; some implementations do not support more than one style sheet and some do not support style sheets at all. If style sheets are turned off or not supported, content will be rendered in document order, so it is important that the content makes sense when read in document order. Optimize style information so that only styles that are used are included. When creating style sheets, take advantage of the CSS media types (these may be used both in the CSS @media rule and in the media attribute of the link element) to specify styles that apply to handheld rendering. The CSS Media types that apply are "handheld" and "all". If handheld rendering is not specified, browsers may download other style sheets even if they are identified as applicable to non-handheld rendering STYLE_SHEETS_USE Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that supports CSS and check that style sheets are used and that the page does not use formatting tags (e.g. font). STYLE_SHEETS_SUPPORT  Human Test: Disable style sheets and check that the page is still readable.  STYLE_SHEETS_SIZE Machine Test: Check that the elements in a style sheet are used in at least one of the pages that reference it. This relates to WCAG 3.3 and 6.1 Content which is marked up in languages such as XML can often be made smaller while preserving exactly the same semantics merely by removal of redundant white space (i.e. spaces and new lines). Marking fonts, colors and other stylistic effects in-line can cause considerably larger page sizes when compared with using logical markup, and use of the HTML class attribute for application of style (see also 5.4.9 Style Sheets). If "pretty printing" is an important part of the authoring process, then try to arrange that redundant white space is stripped when serving a page. Use of structural markup (see 5.4.3 Structural Elements) contributes to minimizing the size of the markup on a page, as does centralizing the style descriptions using CSS [CSS]. Machine Test: Count the number of non-significant white space characters in the document. Transferring content that a device cannot display wastes users' time and money. A device may express a preference for formats. In this case it is good practice to respect the device's preference, as it may have a fuller implementation of those formats. There are problems with using any one approach to the exclusion of the others. Some issues that have been noted by the BPWG in this context are: Some devices do not supply accept headers; Some devices mis-state their capabilities; Some operator gateways supplement the accept headers to include formats that they adapt; User agent headers do not always uniquely identify the device; UAProf information may not be available or may be incomplete. CONTENT_FORMAT_SUPPORT Machine Test: Check MIME types of content with various devices. CONTENT_FORMAT_PREFERRED  Machine Test: Check MIME types of content with various devices and check that the preferred format is sent or that the format is compatible with the Default Delivery Context. As in the previous section, content should not be sent to a device if it can not use it. Machine Test: Check that the encoding is declared in some way and is supported. The content type may be declared in one or more of the following ways: The Content-Type HTTP header, the XML declaration for XML-based content, the CSS @charset rules for CSS, the Content-Type Meta element for HTML content. A "retry" link to attempt the relevant part of the transaction again (note that this may not be equivalent to a page "refresh"); Enter an extraneous URI, known not to represent an actual resource on the site, and check that a HTTP 404 error response is accompanied by a page whose markup is appropriate for the requesting device, or the default context. Cookies are frequently used to carry out session management, to identify users and to store user preferences. Many mobile devices do not implement cookies or offer only an incomplete implementation. In addition, some gateways strip cookies and others simulate cookies on behalf of mobile devices.  Test that cookies are supported by the device on its current access path. If they are not supported, use URI decoration for session management, being careful not to exceed the device's maximum length for such strings. Some gateways provide user identification without setting cookies.  Machine Test: Check that an alternative to cookies is used for session management when they are not available. Set expiry times in a way that is appropriate to your application. Consider using Cache-Control: public to allow sharing of pages between devices, Cache-Control: private to allow re-use but only by the requesting device and Cache-Control: nocache to prevent caching. Machine Test: Check for the presence of cache headers on the HTTP response. Mobile devices often have few fonts and limited support for font sizes and effects (bold, italic etc.) As a result of this, the use of font size, face or effect, for example to highlight an answer or a stressed word, may not achieve the desired effect. See also 5.4.3 Structural Elements. For the Default Delivery Context do not use font related styling. Machine Test: Check for the presence of font related styling in an environment that does not support it. Human Test: If present, ensure that the author's intentions remain clear. This section contains statements relating to user input. This is typically more restrictive on mobile devices than on desktop computers (and often a lot more restrictive). For example, mobile devices may lack pointing devices and often do not have a standard keyboard for text entry. Given the typical input limitations of a mobile device, the interface must as far as possible minimize user input. Where possible, use selection lists, radio buttons and other controls that do not require typing. Some markup languages allow the specification of an input mode, which is particularly useful in cases where user input is to be restricted, for example to numeric only. It is anticipated that XHTML-Basic [XHTML-Basic] will support this functionality in the future. There are a number of techniques available for this, including: Where possible use previous entries as defaults. Make it possible to select items using navigation keys and/or numeric input. AVOID_FREE_TEXT  Machine Test: Check whether input type="text" and textarea are used.  Human Test: If one of them is used, check whether it can be replaced by a pre-determined entry. PROVIDE_DEFAULTS  Machine Test: Check if there is a pre-selected value in controls (selected or checked attribute set).   Human Test: If not, check if there could be sensible pre-selection in the context (e.g. most common choice). DEFAULT_INPUT_MODE Machine Test: Send a request with a device known to support the inputmode attribute and if the response is in a language that supports this attribute, check that it is present on input type="text" and textarea elements. This relates to WCAG 10.4. It is important that as the user navigates through the page the various fields and objects are presented in a logical order, especially as many of them will not be visible at the same time as the focus item. Use document order to control layout and tab order. Machine Test: Check that there are no tabindex attributes or layout effects that affect the order of presentation.  If there are tabindex attributes check that all controls have a tab index and that they are used consistently. Human Test: If there are either tabindex attributes or layout effects that might affect the order of presentation, then check that the order is usable. This means use the label element in HTML, or its equivalent in other languages. Make sure that where the label goes is consistent and close to the form control so re-flowing or adapting the content intelligently will always recognize label controls and keep them together.  Machine Test: Check if the label element is used in forms.   Human Test: Check whether the labels are properly positioned with regard to the controls. This relates to WCAG 10.2 and 12.4.  The Best Practice statements are intended to be capable of  having conformance statements constructed around them in support of the mobileOK trustmark and for other purposes. Work on the mobileOK trustmark will develop specific recommended requirements for a trustmark, which will be based on some profile, or subset, of the  Statements in this document. All of the Best Practice statements have a fragment identifier to allow formal reference to them and allow the construction of compliance claims that refer to them. This specification may be compatible with other specifications that describe a different set of requirements for content, insofar as such requirements do not conflict with the current specification. The Best Practice statements have been assembled by the BPWG from a number of sources. Primary among those are: Various BPWG group meetings and discussions  The editors acknowledge significant written contributions from: Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0 Basic Guidelines W3C Recommendation 29 July 2008 Abstract Status of this Document Table of Contents List of Best Practices 1 Introduction 2 Requirements 3 Delivery Context 4 Structure of Best Practice Statements 5 Best Practice Statements 6 Conformance and mobileOK  A Sources (Non-Normative) B Related Reading (Non-Normative) C Acknowledgements (Non-Normative) D References (Non-Normative) Appendices 1.1 Purpose of the Document 1.2 How the Best Practices are Organized 1.3 Audience 1.4 Scope 1.5 Relationship to other Best Practices and recommendations 1.6 Longevity and Versioning 2.1 Presentation Issues 2.2 Input 2.3 Bandwidth and Cost 2.4 User Goals 2.5 Advertising 2.6 Device Limitations 2.7 Advantages 3.1 One Web 3.2 Background to Adaptation 3.3 Adaptation Implementation Model 3.4 Assumptions about Adaptation 3.5 Establishing Context 3.6 Choice of User Experience 3.7 Default Delivery Context 5.1 Overall Behavior 5.2 Navigation and Links 5.3 Page Layout and Content 5.4 Page Definition 5.5 User Input 6.1 Classes of Products 6.2 Extensibility D.1 MWI References D.2 Sources D.3 Device Independence D.4 Web, Protocols and Languages D.5 Other References 1.4.1 Phasing 5.1.1 Thematic Consistency of Resource Identified by a URI 5.1.2 Exploit Device Capabilities 5.1.3 Work around Deficient Implementations 5.1.4 Testing 5.2.1 URIs of Site Entry Points 5.2.2 Navigation Bar 5.2.3 Balanced Structure 5.2.4 Navigation Mechanisms 5.2.5 Access Keys 5.2.6 Link Target Identification 5.2.7 Image Maps 5.2.8 Refreshing, Redirection and Spawned Windows 5.2.9 Externally Linked Resources 5.3.1 Page Content 5.3.2 Page Size 5.3.3 Scrolling 5.3.4 Navigation Bars etc. (Extraneous material) 5.3.5 Graphics 5.3.6 Color 5.3.7 Background Images 5.4.1 Title 5.4.2 Frames 5.4.3 Structural Elements 5.4.4 Tables 5.4.5 Non-Text Items 5.4.6 Image Size 5.4.7 Valid Markup 5.4.8 Measures 5.4.9 Style Sheets 5.4.10 Minimize 5.4.11 Content Types 5.4.12 Character Encoding 5.4.13 Error Messages 5.4.14 Cookies 5.4.15 Cache Headers 5.4.16 Fonts 5.5.1 Input 5.5.2 Tab Order 5.5.3 Labels for Form Controls 5.1.1.1 What it means 5.1.2.1 What it means 5.1.3.1 What it means 5.1.4.1 What it means 5.1.4.2 How to do it 5.2.1.1 What it means 5.2.1.2 How to do it 5.2.2.1 What it means 5.2.2.2 How to do it 5.2.3.1 What it means 5.2.4.1 What it means 5.2.4.2 How to do it 5.2.4.3 References 5.2.5.1 What it means 5.2.5.2 What to test 5.2.5.3 References 5.2.6.1 What it means 5.2.6.2 How to do it 5.2.6.3 What to test 5.2.6.4 References 5.2.7.1 What it means 5.2.7.2 How to do it 5.2.7.3 What to test 5.2.7.4 References 5.2.8.1 What it means 5.2.8.2 What to test 5.2.8.3 References 5.2.9.1 What it means 5.2.9.2 How to do it 5.2.9.3 What to test 5.3.1.1 What it means 5.3.1.2 What to test 5.3.1.3 References 5.3.2.1 What it means 5.3.2.2 How to do it 5.3.2.3 What to test 5.3.2.4 References 5.3.3.1 What it means 5.3.3.2 How to do it 5.3.3.3 What to test 5.3.4.1 What it means 5.3.4.2 How to do it 5.3.4.3 What to test 5.3.4.4 References 5.3.5.1 What it means 5.3.5.2 What to test 5.3.6.1 What it means 5.3.6.2 What to test 5.3.6.3 References 5.3.7.1 What it means 5.3.7.2 What to test 5.4.1.1 What it means 5.4.1.2 What to test 5.4.2.1 What it means 5.4.2.2 What to test 5.4.2.3 References 5.4.3.1 What it means 5.4.3.2 How to do it 5.4.4.1 What it means 5.4.4.2 What to test 5.4.4.3 References 5.4.5.1 What it means 5.4.5.2 How to do it 5.4.5.3 What to test 5.4.5.4 References 5.4.6.1 What it means 5.4.6.2 What to test 5.4.7.1 What it means 5.4.7.2 What to test 5.4.7.3 References 5.4.8.1 What it means 5.4.8.2 How to do it 5.4.8.3 What to test 5.4.9.1 What it means 5.4.9.2 How to do it 5.4.9.3 What to test 5.4.9.4 References 5.4.10.1 What it means 5.4.10.2 How to do it 5.4.10.3 What to test 5.4.11.1 What it means 5.4.11.2 How to do it 5.4.11.3 What to test 5.4.12.1 What it means 5.4.12.3 What to test 5.4.12.4 References 5.4.13.1 What it means 5.4.13.2 How to do it 5.4.13.3 What to test 5.4.14.1 What it means 5.4.14.2 How to do it 5.4.14.3 What to test 5.4.15.1 What it means 5.4.15.2 How to do it 5.4.15.3 What to test 5.4.15.4 References 5.4.16.1 What it means 5.4.16.2 How to do it 5.4.16.3 What to test 5.5.1.1 What it means 5.5.1.2 How to do it 5.5.1.3 What to test 5.5.1.4 References 5.5.2.1 What it means 5.5.2.2 How to do it 5.5.2.3 What to test 5.5.3.1 What it means 5.5.3.2 What to test 5.5.3.3 References "http://www.example.org/index.html" "http://example.org" "http://www.example.org/example.html" "http://example.org/example" This version: Latest version: Previous version: Editors: Jo Rabin, mTLD Mobile Top Level Domain (dotMobi) Charles McCathieNevile, Opera Software [Early Drafts] 120 pixels, minimum.

This section is not present for process related statements.In this section it is noted whether the statement is Machine Testable (Automated testing is possible) or Human Testable (Testing requires human assessment). Some Best Practices are partially machine testable, i.e. based on the result of an automated test, some human interaction may be required. In such cases both a Machine Testable and a Human Testable statement are present.Some Best Practice statements use words such as "minimize" and "avoid" which are intentionally non-prescriptive. This is in order to provide   guidance while leaving room to accommodate a wide variety of applications whose requirements cannot be anticipated. It also allows creativity and diversity within the same Best Practice framework. More prescriptive advice can be found in the Techniques document [Techniques].

This document specifies Best Practices for delivering Web content to mobile devices. The principal objective is to improve the user experience of the Web when accessed from such devices. The recommendations refer to delivered content and not to the processes by which it is created, nor to the devices or user agents to which it is delivered. It is primarily directed at creators, maintainers and operators of Web sites. Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with the creation of Web sites, and to have a general familiarity with the technologies involved, such as Web servers and HTTP. Readers are not expected to have a background in mobile-specific technologies. This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/. This document was developed by the Best Practices Working Group (BPWG) as part of the Mobile Web Initiative. Please see the Working Group's implementation report. Changes since the previous version of the document are editorial. A complete list of changes made to this document is available. Note the document stayed in Proposed Recommendation for more than a year as it depended on the progress of XHTML Basic 1.1 on the Recommendation track. Please send comments about this document to public-bpwg-comments@w3.org (with public archive). This document combines the experience of many mobile Web stakeholders into one set of best practices, regarded as essential by the participants of the Working Group. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy. This document is informative only. W3C maintains a  public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a  patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which  the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy. The following Best Practices are discussed in this document and listed here for convenience. There is also a free-standing summary.  This document sets out a series of recommendations designed to improve the user experience of the Web on mobile devices.  The recommendations are offered to creators, maintainers and operators of Web sites and are intended as the basis for assessing conformance to the mobileOK trustmark, which is described in the Mobile Web Best Practices Working Group Charter and is not developed in this  document.  At the time of writing of this document, documents describing mobileOK and techniques for implementing the Best Practice recommendations are being worked on. The document is organized as follows: Introduction. Describes the audience, purpose and scope of the document. Requirements. An illustration of the type of problems that the Best Practices are intended to ameliorate. Delivery Context. Discusses the environment within which mobile access to the Web is realized, with particular reference to adaptation. Overview of Best Practices. A discussion of the organization of the Best Practices, and sources from which they were derived. Best Practices. The statements themselves. Conformance and mobileOK. A brief conformance statement and reference to the mobileOK documentation. Appendices Sources Related Reading Acknowledgements References Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with the creation of Web sites, and to have a general familiarity with the technologies involved, such as Web servers and HTTP. Readers are not expected to have a background in mobile-specific technologies. Our intention is to make it clear to all involved what the Best Practices are, and hence establish a common basis of understanding. As a result of wishing to be clear to those not already involved in the development of mobile friendly content, some of our statements may appear to be obvious or trivial to those with experience in this area. The document is not targeted solely at developers; others, such as interaction and graphic designers are encouraged to read it. The scope of these Best Practices is laid out in "Scope of Mobile Web Best Practices" [Scope]. In summary, this document refers primarily to the extension of Web browsing onto mobile devices. The Best Practice recommendations refer to delivered content. While they are clearly relevant to the processes of content creation and rendering on devices, they are not intended to be Best Practices for those activities. As the goal of the document is to specify Best Practices for delivery to mobile devices, statements that do not have a specific mobile aspect are not included. In particular, many Web Content Accessibility [WCAG] guidelines are general to all forms of Web access and are not repeated here unless they have a specific mobile interpretation. Examples of general good practice which have a specific mobile interpretation include "Error Messages" and "Color".  See B Related Reading for information about the related topics of Internationalization, Web Accessibility and Device Independence. As discussed in the Scope document [Scope] there are many  aspects to Mobile Web Best Practices. At present, for example, the design and construction of many Web sites and pages make for a poor user experience when they are viewed on a mobile device. The quality of the user's Web experience via a mobile device depends significantly on the usability of Web sites, of browsers, and of the device itself. Although browser usability  and device usability are important (for reading, navigating, and interacting with content), this document focuses primarily on Best Practices for improving site usability. In future phases other aspects may be considered - e.g. Best Practices as applied to  adaptation and devices. Also in future phases the scope of the recommendations may be extended beyond "Traditional Web Browsing" into fields such as multimodal interaction. These recommendations are in part derived from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG]. As noted above, WCAG guidelines are supplementary to the Mobile Web Best Practices, whose scope is limited to matters that have a specific mobile relevance. This document builds on some of the concepts described by the Device Independence Working  Group (DIWG) in the Device Independence Principles [DIP]. The document discusses device and delivery channel characteristics, which the DIWG has named "Delivery Context"  [DCODI]. In addition, the document uses some terminology from DIWG's Glossary of Terms for  Device Independence [DIGLOSS]. The BPWG is developing a companion document describing techniques [Techniques] by which the Best Practice statements in this document can be implemented. The Best Practices have been written at a level of generality that allows them to be applicable across a range of markup languages. They have been written with enduring properties of mobile access to the Web in mind. While the factors identified in 3.7 Default Delivery Context, such as screen dimensions, will change over time, it seems likely that the distinguishing features of mobile access such as cost and difficulty of input will remain issues. This document may be reviewed from time to time. When necessary, an updated version will be released with clear documentation as to the changes that have been introduced. This section discusses the requirements of the Mobile Web Best Practice statements in section 5. The statement of requirements is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive or complete. Today, Many Web pages are laid out for presentation on desktop size displays, and exploit capabilities of desktop browsing software. Accessing such a Web page on a mobile device often results in a poor or unusable experience. Contributing factors include pages not being laid out as intended. Because of the limited screen size and the limited amount of material that is visible to the user, context and overview are lost. Because of the limited screen size, the subject matter of the page may require considerable scrolling to be visible, especially if the top of the page is occupied by images and navigation links. In these cases the user gets no immediate feedback as to whether their retrieval has resulted in the right content. It is particularly important in the mobile context to help the user create a mental image of the site. This can be assisted by adopting a consistent style and can be considerably diminished by an uneven style. Mobile device input is often difficult when compared with use of a desktop device equipped with a keyboard. Mobile devices often have only a very limited keypad, with small keys, and there is frequently no pointing device. One of the difficulties of the mobile Web is that URIs are very difficult to type. Lengthy URIs and those that contain a lot of punctuation are particularly difficult to type correctly.  Because of the limitations of screen and input, forms are hard to fill in. This is because navigation between fields may not occur in the expected order and because of the difficulty in typing into the fields. While many modern devices provide back buttons, some do not, and in some cases, where back functionality exists, users may not know how to invoke it. This means that it is often very hard to recover from errors, broken links and so on. Mobile networks can be slow compared with fixed data connections and often have a measurably higher latency. This can lead to long retrieval times, especially for lengthy content and for content that requires a lot of navigation between pages. Mobile data transfer often costs money. The fact that mobile devices frequently support only limited types of content means that a user may follow a link and retrieve information that is unusable on their device. Even if the content type can be interpreted by their device there is often an issue with the experience not being satisfactory - for example, larger images may only be viewable in small pieces and require considerable scrolling. Web pages can contain content that the user has not specifically requested - especially advertising and large images. In the mobile world this extra material contributes to poor usability and may add considerably to the cost of the retrieval. Mobile users typically have different interests to users of fixed or desktop devices. They are likely to have more immediate and goal-directed intentions than desktop Web users. Their intentions are often to find out specific pieces of information that are relevant to their context. An example of such a goal-directed application might be the user requiring specific information about schedules for a journey they are currently undertaking. Equally, mobile users are typically less interested in lengthy documents or in browsing. The ergonomics of the device are frequently unsuitable for reading lengthy documents, and users will often only access such information from mobile devices as a last resort, because more convenient access is not available. Developers of commercial Web sites should note that different commercial models are often at work when the Web is accessed from mobile devices as compared with desktop devices. For example, some mechanisms that are commonly used for presentation of advertising material (such as pop-ups, pop-unders and large banners) do not work well on small devices and are therefore contrary to Best Practice recommendations such as [CENTRAL_MEANING], [LARGE_GRAPHICS] and [POP_UPS]. It is not the intention of the MWI to limit or to restrict advertising; rather it is the intention that the user experience of the site as a whole, including advertising, if any, is as effective as possible. As noted above, the restrictions imposed by the keyboard and the screen typically require a different approach to page design than for desktop devices. As detailed in the Scope document [Scope], various other limitations may apply and these have an impact on the usability of the Web from a mobile device. Mobile browsers often do not support scripting or plug-ins, which means that the range of content that they support is limited. In many cases the user has no choice of browser and upgrading it is not possible. Some activities associated with rendering Web pages are computationally intensive - for example re-flowing pages, laying out tables, processing unnecessarily long and complex style sheets and handling invalid markup [T-MOB]. Mobile devices typically have quite limited processing power which means that page rendering may take a noticeable time to complete. As well as introducing a noticeable delay, such processing uses more power as does communication with the server. Many devices have limited memory available for pages and images, and exceeding their memory limitations results in incomplete display and can cause other problems. In discussing the limitations of mobile devices for delivery of Web content it is easy to lose sight of the fact that they are extremely popular and very common. This popularity largely stems at present from them being: personal personalizable portable connected and increasingly multi-functional beyond their original purpose of voice communications. In addition to these factors, the advantages of mobile devices will increasingly include: location awareness one-handed operation always on universal alerting device By way of illustration of some of these factors: the Web can go where you go. You do not have to remember to do something on the Web when you get back to your computer. You can do it immediately, within the context that made you want to use the Web in the first place. Moreover, with mobile devices appearing in all shapes and forms, and  with a growing variety of features like location technology, cameras, voice recognition, touch screens etc, the Web can reach a much wider audience, and at all times in all situations. It has the opportunity to reach into places where wires cannot go, to places previously unthinkable (e.g. providing medical info to mountain rescue scenes) and to accompany everyone as easily as they carry the time on their wristwatches. Finally, today, many more people have access to mobile devices than access to a desktop computer. This is likely to be very significant in developing countries, where Web-capable mobile devices may play as similar a role in deploying wide-spread Web access as the mobile phone has played for providing "plain old telephone service". The recommendations in this document are intended to improve the experience of the Web on mobile devices. While the recommendations are not specifically addressed at the desktop browsing experience, it must be understood that they are made in the context of wishing to work towards "One Web".  As discussed in the Scope document [Scope], One Web means making, as far as is reasonable, the same information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are using. However, it does not mean that exactly the same information is available in exactly the same representation across all devices. The context of mobile use, device capability variations, bandwidth issues and mobile network capabilities all affect the representation. Furthermore, some services and information are more suitable for and targeted at particular user contexts (see 5.1.1 Thematic Consistency of Resource Identified by a URI). Some services have a primarily mobile appeal (location based services, for example). Some have a primarily mobile appeal but have a complementary desktop aspect (for instance for complex configuration tasks). Still others have a primarily desktop appeal but a complementary mobile aspect (possibly for alerting). Finally there will remain some Web applications that have a primarily desktop appeal (lengthy reference material, rich images, for example). It is likely that application designers and service providers will wish to provide the best possible experience in the context in which their service has the most appeal. However, while services may be most appropriately experienced in one context or another, it is considered best practice to provide as reasonable experience as is possible given device limitations and not to exclude access from any particular class of device, except where this is necessary because of device limitations. From the perspective of this document this means that services should be available as some variant of HTML over HTTP (see 3.7 Default Delivery Context). The widely varying characteristics of mobile devices can make it difficult for a Web site to provide an acceptable user experience across a significant range of devices. For example different devices support different markup features and different screen sizes may demand different sized images. Consequently, it is very common when delivering content to mobile devices to vary the details of the markup, format of images, image sizes, color depths and so on to suit the characteristics of the device in question. The process of altering content to enhance the user experience on particular devices is referred to as Content Adaptation. We do not describe adaptation in detail in this document. For a more detailed description, readers are referred to the Device Independence Principles [DIP]. In addition, the sister group of the Best Practices Working Group, the Device Description Working Group, is currently defining requirements for a repository of mobile device characteristics that are relevant to content adaptation. There are a number of different implementation models for content adaptation. On the one hand, adaptation may be quite simple and consist of determining the device type and choosing the most appropriate set of previously prepared content to match the device characteristics. At the other extreme it may be carried out in a completely dynamic way, with content formatted at the time of retrieval, taking into account not only statically determined properties, such as screen dimension, but also dynamically determined properties, such as the temporary attachment of a fully featured keyboard.  Adaptation can be carried out in a number of different points in the delivery of content to the device [DCODI]: Whatever the adaptation model at work, the process of adaptation should not diminish accessibility. In phase 1 (See 1.4.1 Phasing) it is assumed that content adaptation, if any, is carried out Server Side. Future phases may consider the implications of content adaptation elsewhere, especially the issues concerning the granting of authority to third parties to carry out adaptation, prohibiting adaptation and so on. Later phases may also address multiple adaptation - i.e. the possibility that adaptation can be applied at more than one point and that In-Network adaptation may occur more than once. It is also assumed that it is possible to create a site that is consistent with the Best Practice recommendations without carrying out adaptation at all. However it is likely that a more sophisticated and enhanced user experience will be achieved if adaptation is used. Providing variations on the user experience that are appropriate in different cases requires the content provider to know a significant amount about the characteristics of the device, the properties of the browser in use and the transparency of the network connection to the device. For simple sites that present an interface which is similar across a broad range of contexts the need for such information is diminished when compared with a sophisticated site that has an optimized navigation structure, presents different size images or carries out other adaptations to suit the particular delivery context. There are several methods by which a content provider can discover information about the delivery context, such as  CC/PP, UAPROF, CSS Media Queries and various outputs of the Device Independence Working Group. The companion Techniques [Techniques] document describes these methods. In the interests of "One Web" (see 3.1 One Web) considerations, the content provider may choose to allow the user to select from broad categories such as mobile or desktop presentation, where these are distinguished in the application. If the presentation option has been determined automatically, the content provider may choose to allow the user to override the automatic determination. Where a choice of presentations is available, it is good practice to record the user's preferences and to allow them to be changed. Given an appropriate server environment, it is unlikely that the content provider will be unable to find out anything about the delivery context. However this can happen, either because details of the delivery context are not available in sufficient detail or because the server does not provide the ability to inspect and act on the information provided. In this case a "reasonable default experience" should be provided. The details of the default experience depend upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the geographic region in which the service is offered and the primary intention of the service (e.g. considering whether the service is primarily desktop focused vs. primarily mobile focused). In order to allow content providers to share a consistent view of a default mobile experience the BPWG has defined the Default Delivery Context. This allows providers to create appropriate experiences in the absence of adaptation and provides a baseline experience where adaptation is used. The Default Delivery Context has been determined by the BPWG as being the minimum delivery context specification necessary for a reasonable experience of the Web. It is recognized that devices that do not meet this specification can provide a reasonable experience of other non-Web services. It is also recognized that this specification is made against the background of demographic, cultural and economic assumptions. Content providers may choose to provide services that demand a different or lower delivery context specification, but should try to provide an experience that exploits the capabilities of the Default Delivery Context in order to provide the best possible experience for that context. It is stressed that many devices exceed the capabilities defined by the DDC. Content providers are encouraged not to diminish the user experience on those devices by developing only to the DDC specification, and are encouraged to adapt their content, where appropriate, to exploit the capabilities of the actual device. In summary, the purpose of defining the DDC is to support the following rules: If an adaptation process is used, then information that is known about the actual Delivery Context should (see 5.1.2 Exploit Device Capabilities) be used to vary the delivered content to make it more suitable for that specific Delivery Context or to provide an enhanced user experience. If the delivered content does not result from an adaptation process - e.g. the content is statically defined as HTML stored in files, or the details of the Delivery Context cannot adequately be determined, then the delivered content should be suitable for the Default Delivery Context and should comply with the Best Practice statements. The Default Delivery Context is defined as follows: 120 pixels, minimum. XHTML Basic 1.1 [XHTML-Basic] delivered with content type application/xhtml+xml. UTF-8 [UTF-8]. JPEG. GIF 89a. 20 kilobytes. 256 Colors, minimum. CSS Level 1 [CSS]. In addition, CSS Level 2 [CSS2] @media  rule together with the handheld and all media types (see CSS 2 Media Types). HTTP/1.0 [HTTP1.0] or more recent [HTTP1.1]. No support for client side scripting. The functional area that is addressed by the statements. One or more Best Practice statements, identified in the following way: An explanation of the significance of the statements under this heading.  A discussion of techniques and some suggestions as to how to implement. The BPWG is creating a separate document describing techniques [Techniques] in more detail. The aspects of the delivered content that an external validator could examine to assess conformance with the Best Practice statements. This section is not present for process related statements. In this section it is noted whether the statement is Machine Testable (Automated testing is possible) or Human Testable (Testing requires human assessment). Some Best Practices are partially machine testable, i.e. based on the result of an automated test, some human interaction may be required. In such cases both a Machine Testable and a Human Testable statement are present. Some Best Practice statements use words such as "minimize" and "avoid" which are intentionally non-prescriptive. This is in order to provide   guidance while leaving room to accommodate a wide variety of applications whose requirements cannot be anticipated. It also allows creativity and diversity within the same Best Practice framework. More prescriptive advice can be found in the Techniques document [Techniques]. Where appropriate, references to related WCAG points and other immediate references from the preceding text. The Best Practice statements are grouped under the following headings There are some general principles that underlie delivery to mobile devices.  A bookmark captured on one device should be usable on another, different type of device even if it does not yield exactly the same experience. If the page that was bookmarked is not appropriate for the device that is now using it,  an alternative that is suitable should be provided.  Just as in the desktop world, there are browsers that do not respect the intentions of the content provider. There are differences in interpretation between browsers and there are also deficiencies in implementation. By deficient we mean non-support of mandatory features of a relevant standard or recommendation and other bugs or errors in implementation.  Just as it is not the intention to recommend a least common denominator approach, neither is it the intention to recommend avoiding features that exhibit problems on some class of devices. It is also not the intention to suggest that content providers should restrict their support to certain device types. Content providers should aim to support as wide a range of device types as is practical. Any Web site should be tested in a range of browsers. Mobile browsers often show markedly different characteristics to desktop browsers. As well as assessing a site's suitability for display in reduced format, content providers are encouraged to test that the features they rely on work in actual devices.  Content providers should also test with specific features disabled, such as using text-only modes and with scripting disabled. Many manufacturers provide emulators for their device that can provide a convenient preliminary means of testing. However, in practice, many of the emulators behave in a different way to the devices they emulate. Consequently testing should be carried out in as wide a range of real devices and specific software versions as is practical. Because of the limitations in display and of input mechanisms, the possible absence of a pointing device and other constraints of mobile devices, care should be exercised in defining the structure and the navigation model of a Web site. allow and instead of  allow Provide the basic links on a single line.  The design should aim to provide a balance between having a large number of navigation links on a page and the need to navigate multiple links to reach content. Using the same navigation mechanisms across a service helps users orient themselves and allows them to identify navigation mechanisms more easily. At each target of the drill-down navigation an "up" link should be provided to allow the user to jump up an entire section. This relates to WCAG 13.4. Where there is no pointing device, assigning an access key (keyboard short cut) to a link can provide a convenient way for users to access the link and avoid navigating to the link by repeated pressing of the navigation key. Machine Test: Test for the presence of the accesskey attribute. This relates to WCAG 9.5. Users of mobile devices may suffer undue delay and cost as a result of following links. It is important to identify where a link leads so users can make an assessment of whether following it will be of interest to them. While it is unlikely that the cost in monetary terms of a particular user following a particular link can be specified, it should be possible to give an idea of the size of the resource (in bytes or in an abstract way, e.g. large file). Links to content that is in a different format or different language to that of the page the link is on (i.e. content that can only be interpreted by other applications or downloads) should be human signposted, so that users are not lead to download content that their device may not be able to use. However, bear in mind that some devices support the rendering of those formats by other applications once downloaded (e.g. music files). Additionally, users may wish to download content for later transfer to other devices altogether. So even if it is known that the user agent does not support a particular content type, that content should still be made available. For the Default Delivery Context all formats other than XHTML, GIF and JPG should be noted.  Human Test: Check for proper descriptions (e.g. no use of "Click here"). Machine Test: Check for links to non-HTML formats. Human Test: If present check whether there is information about the format of the target of the link. This relates to WCAG 11.3 and 13.1. Many mobile devices lack a pointing device and server-side image maps cannot be used on such devices. For the Default Delivery Context, or if a satisfactory image map cannot be displayed, use a list of links with descriptive text instead. IMAGE_MAPS Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that does not support client-side image maps and check the map element is not present. This relates to WCAG 1.2 and 9.1. Each of these activities is likely to cause the user confusion, or add cost and delay to their interaction. Some mobile devices use a separate window for input; this section does not refer to such windows. Many mobile devices cannot support more than one window and consequently, attempting to open one will have unpredictable results. While redirection is a commonly employed mechanism, it must be remembered that redirection usually requires a round-trip to the browser. This adds to delay on slow links; so use a maximum of one redirect per page and limit the number of pages that are redirected. POP_UPS Machine Test: Look for the target attribute on links and if present check to see if it has a value different from _self, _parent or _top. AUTO_REFRESH  Machine Test: Check whether meta http-equiv="refresh" content="&lt;the same URI&gt;" is used. REDIRECTION Machine Test: Check whether meta http-equiv="refresh" content="&lt;a different URI&gt;" is used. This relates to WCAG 7.4, 7.5 and 10.1. Each linked resource (images, style sheets and other objects) requires a separate request across the network. This may add significantly to the load time of the page in the mobile context. Minimize the number of images on a page and consolidate style information into a single sheet per page (see also 5.4.9 Style Sheets). Machine Test: Count the number of linked images, style sheets and other linked items. Human Test: Review whether a similar effect could be obtained using fewer links. Users in a mobile context are often looking for specific pieces of information, rather than browsing. Content providers should consider the likely context of use of information and, while providing the option to access all information, should offer appropriate information first. See also discussion under 2.4 User Goals and 3.1 One Web. The general prescription to use clear language is of particular importance for mobile delivery, where brevity and directness are generally more desirable than a discursive style. Writing content in the traditional journalistic "front loaded" style can assist users determining whether information is of interest to them and allow them to skip it more easily if it is not. Placing distinguishing information at the beginning of headings,  paragraphs, lists, etc. can also help the user contextualize when using devices with limited screen area. See also 5.3.4 Navigation Bars etc. (Extraneous material) for a discussion of making sure that the subject matter of the page is near the top. Mobile users often pay for bandwidth, so offering them content that is extraneous to their needs, especially advertising, costs them time and money and contributes to an unsatisfactory experience.  In general, the user's consent should be sought before initiating the download of content. Human Test: Examine content to determine if, given the subject matter, it is appropriate in a mobile context. This relates to WCAG 13.8 and 14.1. If pages are too big they may take an unduly long time to load. In addition, mobile devices typically have restrictions on the largest page they can accommodate. On the other hand, if pages are too short then the user will be required to make multiple requests to read the relevant information. This can lead to an unnecessary delay, since each request typically takes a measurable time to complete. The balance between pagination and scrolling is partly a matter of taste and partly a matter of necessity. Devices with severe memory restrictions can only have small pages delivered to them. Equally some devices offer a poor scrolling experience and a better page retrieval experience. Some studies [MF] have been carried out in this area to test for user preferences. Some of these indicate that users prefer scrolling to click-throughs and some indicate the contrary. More research is likely to be needed in this area.   For the Default Delivery Context assume the limits specified in 3.7 Default Delivery Context.  PAGE_SIZE_USABLE Machine Test: Measure the total size of the markup for a page; check that it does not exceed 10 kilobytes for the Default Delivery Context. Human Test: Check that the page is still usable (e.g. not cut in the middle of a sentence, just before the end of a section, and so on). PAGE_SIZE_LIMIT Machine Test: Measure the total size of markup and images for a page; check that it does not go over the allowed size for the device - 20 kilobytes for the Default Delivery Context. This relates to WCAG 12.3. The page should lay out so that simple repeated scrolling in the same direction (axis) allows the user to experience all its content. However some content (such as maps and other images) cannot be displayed without secondary scrolling.  If some element on the page requires secondary scrolling it must not cause the remainder of the page to require this. For example, if an object causes subsequent text to lay out with a significant margin to its left, then this text may not be visible once a user has scrolled past the object. Equally, if the presence of such an object causes text to render beyond the right boundary of the page then the user will be required to scroll to read each line of text. If it is not possible to avoid presenting images that are larger than the screen size, then consider providing these images on a separate page with a link back to the main content. In the Default Delivery Context assume a width of 120 pixels. SCROLLING Machine Test: Check for width attributes and width style properties wider than the screen size - for the Default Delivery Context, 120 pixels. Human Test: If it is wider than the screen size, check that the use case warrants it (e.g. maps). Browse URIs within a site with a mobile device and observe that on pages with elements that require secondary scrolling only those elements require it, and the rest of the page requires only primary scrolling. Many Web pages are designed with significant navigational and other elements at the top of or to the side of the page (e.g. Menu Bars, Breadcrumb Trails and Search Functions). This provides a convenient and well-understood navigational metaphor on large displays. However, on small displays this can result in the navigation appearing instead of the actual content of the page when the page is first retrieved.  Because it is important for the user to gain an idea of the content of the page on initial view, there should be a minimum amount of clutter preceding this - including navigation, decorative images, advertising and other material that is not central to the user's experience of the page. The user should not have to scroll significantly to find the primary content of the page. See also 5.3.1 Page Content for a discussion of how writing style can help the user identify meaning. Human test: Browse URIs within a site with a mobile device and observe that the most important/relevant information is conveyed first. This relates to WCAG 13.5. The popular mechanism of using a 1 pixel graphic for absolute positioning does not work on a variety of screens. GRAPHICS_FOR_SPACING Machine Test: Check for very small and/or transparent graphics. LARGE_GRAPHICS  Machine Test: Check dimensions of graphics. Mobile devices often do not have good color contrast and are often used in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. Hence information highlighted in color may not be visible to users. If color is used to indicate a feature then that feature should generally also be indicated in a way that is not color dependent. In particular, do not use blue or purple text, as this may be confused with hyperlinks, especially on devices that do not underline links. USE_OF_COLOR  Human Test: Browse the page in a monochrome environment. COLOR_CONTRAST Human Test: Browse the page under a strong light parallel to the screen. Machine Test: There are automatic tools to test color contrast. This relates to WCAG 2.1 and 2.2. Images that are used indiscriminately can lead to content that is hard to view, particularly with the limited contrast often found on mobile devices and in the hostile viewing conditions in which mobile devices are frequently used. Before using background images, consider carefully your objectives for doing so and try to use alternative techniques to achieve similar objectives. If you use a background image ensure that the content is readable with and without the background image for devices that do not support them. Machine Test: Test for the presence of a background image. Human Test: Test readability both on devices that support them and devices that do not. Provide a descriptive title for the page to allow easy identification. Keep the title short to reduce page weight, and bear in mind that it may be truncated. Many mobile browsers do not display the title of a page. Where the title is displayed the available space may be limited. The device may use the page title as the default label for bookmarks. Again, space may be limited, so use it to help identify the content and not for other purposes. Machine Test: Test for presence of the title element. Human Test: Test that the title is descriptive of content. Many mobile devices do not support frames. In addition, frames are recognized as being generally problematic.  Machine Test: Test for presence of frame related elements -  check for frameset and iframe elements. See  http://www.w3.org/TR/xframes/#s_intro for a discussion of problems with frames. It is good practice for all but the simplest documents to indicate their structure through headings and sub-headings. Using structural markup, rather than formatting effects, allows easier adaptation of content where it needs to be divided into several pages, as well as potentially facilitating access to the sections of the document that a user is interested in. Where headings are used they should be used in accordance with the specification, i.e. they should be properly nested according to their level. Structural markup must not be used solely to create a font effect (see also 5.4.3 Structural Elements). Markup languages like HMTL contain many constructs to indicate structure. Tables do not work well on limited size screens and may result in the user having to scroll horizontally to read them. Putting navigational links into tables may result in the user having both to scroll horizontally and vertically to see possible navigational choices. TABLES_SUPPORT Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that does not support tables and check the table element is not present. Machine Test: Check that there are no nested tables. TABLES_LAYOUT Machine Test: Check that no column or row in a table is empty or contains only a 1x1 transparent GIF. Machine Test: If there is a table element, check to see whether there is rendered content outside the element. If there is not then it is likely that the table is being used for layout. This relates to WCAG 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5 and 5.6. A non-text item is defined by Non-text content in the WAI Glossary [WAIGlossary]. Downloading images to a mobiledevice adds to the time to display an image and the cost of displaying the page. Making the page readable in text-only mode can help the user assess its usefulness before images arrive. Many mobile devices do not support embedded objects or script and in many cases it is not possible for users to load plug-ins to add support. Content must be designed with this in mind.  Even where a device does support scripting, do not use it unless there is no other way of accomplishing your objectives. Scripting increases power consumption and so decreases battery life. Design pages so that they are useful when rendered as text-only. See also 5.1.4 Testing. Always use features of the markup designed to support alternate rendering such as the longdesc and alt attributes in XHTML. Use only features from the markup that are known to be supported by the device in question. Avoid things like CSS image replacement and pictures of words. If scripting is used, do not use onmouse and onkey triggers, use onclick. NON-TEXT_ALTERNATIVES Machine Test: Test for presence of alt attribute on images and text content on objects. Human Test: Check the relevance of the meaning of the content of alt attributes. OBJECTS_OR_SCRIPT Machine Test: Test for the presence of object or script elements in content delivered to a device that does not support them and if present carry out the Human Test below. Human Test: If present, test that the user experience is acceptable. This relates to WCAG 1.1, 3.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 and 9.2. Note that this recommendation contrasts with 5.4.8 Measures, which recommends using relative measures where possible. IMAGES_SPECIFY_SIZE Machine Test: Test for presence of width and height attributes on img elements. IMAGES_RESIZING  Machine Test: Check width and height attributes are equal to image dimensions. If the page markup is invalid this will result in unpredictable and possibly incomplete presentation.  Machine Test: Validate documents. This relates to WCAG 3.2, 11.1 and 11.2.  See http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/#validators.  Avoiding pixel and absolute measures allows the browser to adapt content to fit the display. An exception to rule is where an image has been specifically sized for a particular display (see 5.4.6 Image Size). In this case references to the image in markup may specify the exact dimensions of the image in pixels, in order to help the browser to flow the page and avoid re-flowing it after the page has been retrieved. Devices may realize the intentions of authors more accurately if margins, borders and padding are specified in pixels. Use percentage and relative measures such as em, ex, bolder, larger and thick. Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that supports relative measures correctly and check the values of font-size are not absolute or pixels. Style information may be contained in an externally linked style sheet or, in HTML, may be contained either in a style element or in a style attribute on specific elements. Mobile devices offer varying support for style sheets. Some provide full implementations, including caching of external style sheets; some do not cache external style sheets; some do not support the style element; some implementations do not support more than one style sheet and some do not support style sheets at all. If style sheets are turned off or not supported, content will be rendered in document order, so it is important that the content makes sense when read in document order. Optimize style information so that only styles that are used are included. When creating style sheets, take advantage of the CSS media types (these may be used both in the CSS @media rule and in the media attribute of the link element) to specify styles that apply to handheld rendering. The CSS Media types that apply are "handheld" and "all". If handheld rendering is not specified, browsers may download other style sheets even if they are identified as applicable to non-handheld rendering STYLE_SHEETS_USE Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that supports CSS and check that style sheets are used and that the page does not use formatting tags (e.g. font). STYLE_SHEETS_SUPPORT  Human Test: Disable style sheets and check that the page is still readable.  STYLE_SHEETS_SIZE Machine Test: Check that the elements in a style sheet are used in at least one of the pages that reference it. This relates to WCAG 3.3 and 6.1 Content which is marked up in languages such as XML can often be made smaller while preserving exactly the same semantics merely by removal of redundant white space (i.e. spaces and new lines). Marking fonts, colors and other stylistic effects in-line can cause considerably larger page sizes when compared with using logical markup, and use of the HTML class attribute for application of style (see also 5.4.9 Style Sheets). If "pretty printing" is an important part of the authoring process, then try to arrange that redundant white space is stripped when serving a page. Use of structural markup (see 5.4.3 Structural Elements) contributes to minimizing the size of the markup on a page, as does centralizing the style descriptions using CSS [CSS]. Machine Test: Count the number of non-significant white space characters in the document. Transferring content that a device cannot display wastes users' time and money. A device may express a preference for formats. In this case it is good practice to respect the device's preference, as it may have a fuller implementation of those formats. There are problems with using any one approach to the exclusion of the others. Some issues that have been noted by the BPWG in this context are: Some devices do not supply accept headers; Some devices mis-state their capabilities; Some operator gateways supplement the accept headers to include formats that they adapt; User agent headers do not always uniquely identify the device; UAProf information may not be available or may be incomplete. CONTENT_FORMAT_SUPPORT Machine Test: Check MIME types of content with various devices. CONTENT_FORMAT_PREFERRED  Machine Test: Check MIME types of content with various devices and check that the preferred format is sent or that the format is compatible with the Default Delivery Context. As in the previous section, content should not be sent to a device if it can not use it. Machine Test: Check that the encoding is declared in some way and is supported. The content type may be declared in one or more of the following ways: The Content-Type HTTP header, the XML declaration for XML-based content, the CSS @charset rules for CSS, the Content-Type Meta element for HTML content. A "retry" link to attempt the relevant part of the transaction again (note that this may not be equivalent to a page "refresh"); Enter an extraneous URI, known not to represent an actual resource on the site, and check that a HTTP 404 error response is accompanied by a page whose markup is appropriate for the requesting device, or the default context. Cookies are frequently used to carry out session management, to identify users and to store user preferences. Many mobile devices do not implement cookies or offer only an incomplete implementation. In addition, some gateways strip cookies and others simulate cookies on behalf of mobile devices.  Test that cookies are supported by the device on its current access path. If they are not supported, use URI decoration for session management, being careful not to exceed the device's maximum length for such strings. Some gateways provide user identification without setting cookies.  Machine Test: Check that an alternative to cookies is used for session management when they are not available. Set expiry times in a way that is appropriate to your application. Consider using Cache-Control: public to allow sharing of pages between devices, Cache-Control: private to allow re-use but only by the requesting device and Cache-Control: nocache to prevent caching. Machine Test: Check for the presence of cache headers on the HTTP response. Mobile devices often have few fonts and limited support for font sizes and effects (bold, italic etc.) As a result of this, the use of font size, face or effect, for example to highlight an answer or a stressed word, may not achieve the desired effect. See also 5.4.3 Structural Elements. For the Default Delivery Context do not use font related styling. Machine Test: Check for the presence of font related styling in an environment that does not support it. Human Test: If present, ensure that the author's intentions remain clear. This section contains statements relating to user input. This is typically more restrictive on mobile devices than on desktop computers (and often a lot more restrictive). For example, mobile devices may lack pointing devices and often do not have a standard keyboard for text entry. Given the typical input limitations of a mobile device, the interface must as far as possible minimize user input. Where possible, use selection lists, radio buttons and other controls that do not require typing. Some markup languages allow the specification of an input mode, which is particularly useful in cases where user input is to be restricted, for example to numeric only. It is anticipated that XHTML-Basic [XHTML-Basic] will support this functionality in the future. There are a number of techniques available for this, including: Where possible use previous entries as defaults. Make it possible to select items using navigation keys and/or numeric input. AVOID_FREE_TEXT  Machine Test: Check whether input type="text" and textarea are used.  Human Test: If one of them is used, check whether it can be replaced by a pre-determined entry. PROVIDE_DEFAULTS  Machine Test: Check if there is a pre-selected value in controls (selected or checked attribute set).   Human Test: If not, check if there could be sensible pre-selection in the context (e.g. most common choice). DEFAULT_INPUT_MODE Machine Test: Send a request with a device known to support the inputmode attribute and if the response is in a language that supports this attribute, check that it is present on input type="text" and textarea elements. This relates to WCAG 10.4. It is important that as the user navigates through the page the various fields and objects are presented in a logical order, especially as many of them will not be visible at the same time as the focus item. Use document order to control layout and tab order. Machine Test: Check that there are no tabindex attributes or layout effects that affect the order of presentation.  If there are tabindex attributes check that all controls have a tab index and that they are used consistently. Human Test: If there are either tabindex attributes or layout effects that might affect the order of presentation, then check that the order is usable. This means use the label element in HTML, or its equivalent in other languages. Make sure that where the label goes is consistent and close to the form control so re-flowing or adapting the content intelligently will always recognize label controls and keep them together.  Machine Test: Check if the label element is used in forms.   Human Test: Check whether the labels are properly positioned with regard to the controls. This relates to WCAG 10.2 and 12.4.  The Best Practice statements are intended to be capable of  having conformance statements constructed around them in support of the mobileOK trustmark and for other purposes. Work on the mobileOK trustmark will develop specific recommended requirements for a trustmark, which will be based on some profile, or subset, of the  Statements in this document. All of the Best Practice statements have a fragment identifier to allow formal reference to them and allow the construction of compliance claims that refer to them. This specification may be compatible with other specifications that describe a different set of requirements for content, insofar as such requirements do not conflict with the current specification. The Best Practice statements have been assembled by the BPWG from a number of sources. Primary among those are: Various BPWG group meetings and discussions  The editors acknowledge significant written contributions from: Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0 Basic Guidelines W3C Recommendation 29 July 2008 Abstract Status of this Document Table of Contents List of Best Practices 1 Introduction 2 Requirements 3 Delivery Context 4 Structure of Best Practice Statements 5 Best Practice Statements 6 Conformance and mobileOK  A Sources (Non-Normative) B Related Reading (Non-Normative) C Acknowledgements (Non-Normative) D References (Non-Normative) Appendices 1.1 Purpose of the Document 1.2 How the Best Practices are Organized 1.3 Audience 1.4 Scope 1.5 Relationship to other Best Practices and recommendations 1.6 Longevity and Versioning 2.1 Presentation Issues 2.2 Input 2.3 Bandwidth and Cost 2.4 User Goals 2.5 Advertising 2.6 Device Limitations 2.7 Advantages 3.1 One Web 3.2 Background to Adaptation 3.3 Adaptation Implementation Model 3.4 Assumptions about Adaptation 3.5 Establishing Context 3.6 Choice of User Experience 3.7 Default Delivery Context 5.1 Overall Behavior 5.2 Navigation and Links 5.3 Page Layout and Content 5.4 Page Definition 5.5 User Input 6.1 Classes of Products 6.2 Extensibility D.1 MWI References D.2 Sources D.3 Device Independence D.4 Web, Protocols and Languages D.5 Other References 1.4.1 Phasing 5.1.1 Thematic Consistency of Resource Identified by a URI 5.1.2 Exploit Device Capabilities 5.1.3 Work around Deficient Implementations 5.1.4 Testing 5.2.1 URIs of Site Entry Points 5.2.2 Navigation Bar 5.2.3 Balanced Structure 5.2.4 Navigation Mechanisms 5.2.5 Access Keys 5.2.6 Link Target Identification 5.2.7 Image Maps 5.2.8 Refreshing, Redirection and Spawned Windows 5.2.9 Externally Linked Resources 5.3.1 Page Content 5.3.2 Page Size 5.3.3 Scrolling 5.3.4 Navigation Bars etc. (Extraneous material) 5.3.5 Graphics 5.3.6 Color 5.3.7 Background Images 5.4.1 Title 5.4.2 Frames 5.4.3 Structural Elements 5.4.4 Tables 5.4.5 Non-Text Items 5.4.6 Image Size 5.4.7 Valid Markup 5.4.8 Measures 5.4.9 Style Sheets 5.4.10 Minimize 5.4.11 Content Types 5.4.12 Character Encoding 5.4.13 Error Messages 5.4.14 Cookies 5.4.15 Cache Headers 5.4.16 Fonts 5.5.1 Input 5.5.2 Tab Order 5.5.3 Labels for Form Controls 5.1.1.1 What it means 5.1.2.1 What it means 5.1.3.1 What it means 5.1.4.1 What it means 5.1.4.2 How to do it 5.2.1.1 What it means 5.2.1.2 How to do it 5.2.2.1 What it means 5.2.2.2 How to do it 5.2.3.1 What it means 5.2.4.1 What it means 5.2.4.2 How to do it 5.2.4.3 References 5.2.5.1 What it means 5.2.5.2 What to test 5.2.5.3 References 5.2.6.1 What it means 5.2.6.2 How to do it 5.2.6.3 What to test 5.2.6.4 References 5.2.7.1 What it means 5.2.7.2 How to do it 5.2.7.3 What to test 5.2.7.4 References 5.2.8.1 What it means 5.2.8.2 What to test 5.2.8.3 References 5.2.9.1 What it means 5.2.9.2 How to do it 5.2.9.3 What to test 5.3.1.1 What it means 5.3.1.2 What to test 5.3.1.3 References 5.3.2.1 What it means 5.3.2.2 How to do it 5.3.2.3 What to test 5.3.2.4 References 5.3.3.1 What it means 5.3.3.2 How to do it 5.3.3.3 What to test 5.3.4.1 What it means 5.3.4.2 How to do it 5.3.4.3 What to test 5.3.4.4 References 5.3.5.1 What it means 5.3.5.2 What to test 5.3.6.1 What it means 5.3.6.2 What to test 5.3.6.3 References 5.3.7.1 What it means 5.3.7.2 What to test 5.4.1.1 What it means 5.4.1.2 What to test 5.4.2.1 What it means 5.4.2.2 What to test 5.4.2.3 References 5.4.3.1 What it means 5.4.3.2 How to do it 5.4.4.1 What it means 5.4.4.2 What to test 5.4.4.3 References 5.4.5.1 What it means 5.4.5.2 How to do it 5.4.5.3 What to test 5.4.5.4 References 5.4.6.1 What it means 5.4.6.2 What to test 5.4.7.1 What it means 5.4.7.2 What to test 5.4.7.3 References 5.4.8.1 What it means 5.4.8.2 How to do it 5.4.8.3 What to test 5.4.9.1 What it means 5.4.9.2 How to do it 5.4.9.3 What to test 5.4.9.4 References 5.4.10.1 What it means 5.4.10.2 How to do it 5.4.10.3 What to test 5.4.11.1 What it means 5.4.11.2 How to do it 5.4.11.3 What to test 5.4.12.1 What it means 5.4.12.3 What to test 5.4.12.4 References 5.4.13.1 What it means 5.4.13.2 How to do it 5.4.13.3 What to test 5.4.14.1 What it means 5.4.14.2 How to do it 5.4.14.3 What to test 5.4.15.1 What it means 5.4.15.2 How to do it 5.4.15.3 What to test 5.4.15.4 References 5.4.16.1 What it means 5.4.16.2 How to do it 5.4.16.3 What to test 5.5.1.1 What it means 5.5.1.2 How to do it 5.5.1.3 What to test 5.5.1.4 References 5.5.2.1 What it means 5.5.2.2 How to do it 5.5.2.3 What to test 5.5.3.1 What it means 5.5.3.2 What to test 5.5.3.3 References "http://www.example.org/index.html" "http://example.org" "http://www.example.org/example.html" "http://example.org/example" This version: Latest version: Previous version: Editors: Jo Rabin, mTLD Mobile Top Level Domain (dotMobi) Charles McCathieNevile, Opera Software [Early Drafts] 120 pixels, minimum.

Some Best Practices are partially machine testable, i.e. based on the result of an automated test, some human interaction may be required. In such cases both a Machine Testable and a Human Testable statement are present.Some Best Practice statements use words such as "minimize" and "avoid" which are intentionally non-prescriptive. This is in order to provide   guidance while leaving room to accommodate a wide variety of applications whose requirements cannot be anticipated. It also allows creativity and diversity within the same Best Practice framework. More prescriptive advice can be found in the Techniques document [Techniques].

This document specifies Best Practices for delivering Web content to mobile devices. The principal objective is to improve the user experience of the Web when accessed from such devices. The recommendations refer to delivered content and not to the processes by which it is created, nor to the devices or user agents to which it is delivered. It is primarily directed at creators, maintainers and operators of Web sites. Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with the creation of Web sites, and to have a general familiarity with the technologies involved, such as Web servers and HTTP. Readers are not expected to have a background in mobile-specific technologies. This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication.

Please send comments about this document to public-bpwg-comments@w3.org (with public archive). This document combines the experience of many mobile Web stakeholders into one set of best practices, regarded as essential by the participants of the Working Group. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy. This document is informative only. W3C maintains a  public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a  patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which  the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy. The following Best Practices are discussed in this document and listed here for convenience. There is also a free-standing summary.  This document sets out a series of recommendations designed to improve the user experience of the Web on mobile devices.  The recommendations are offered to creators, maintainers and operators of Web sites and are intended as the basis for assessing conformance to the mobileOK trustmark, which is described in the Mobile Web Best Practices Working Group Charter and is not developed in this  document.  At the time of writing of this document, documents describing mobileOK and techniques for implementing the Best Practice recommendations are being worked on. The document is organized as follows: Introduction. Describes the audience, purpose and scope of the document. Requirements. An illustration of the type of problems that the Best Practices are intended to ameliorate. Delivery Context. Discusses the environment within which mobile access to the Web is realized, with particular reference to adaptation. Overview of Best Practices. A discussion of the organization of the Best Practices, and sources from which they were derived. Best Practices. The statements themselves. Conformance and mobileOK. A brief conformance statement and reference to the mobileOK documentation. Appendices Sources Related Reading Acknowledgements References Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with the creation of Web sites, and to have a general familiarity with the technologies involved, such as Web servers and HTTP. Readers are not expected to have a background in mobile-specific technologies. Our intention is to make it clear to all involved what the Best Practices are, and hence establish a common basis of understanding. As a result of wishing to be clear to those not already involved in the development of mobile friendly content, some of our statements may appear to be obvious or trivial to those with experience in this area. The document is not targeted solely at developers; others, such as interaction and graphic designers are encouraged to read it. The scope of these Best Practices is laid out in "Scope of Mobile Web Best Practices" [Scope]. In summary, this document refers primarily to the extension of Web browsing onto mobile devices. The Best Practice recommendations refer to delivered content. While they are clearly relevant to the processes of content creation and rendering on devices, they are not intended to be Best Practices for those activities. As the goal of the document is to specify Best Practices for delivery to mobile devices, statements that do not have a specific mobile aspect are not included. In particular, many Web Content Accessibility [WCAG] guidelines are general to all forms of Web access and are not repeated here unless they have a specific mobile interpretation. Examples of general good practice which have a specific mobile interpretation include "Error Messages" and "Color".  See B Related Reading for information about the related topics of Internationalization, Web Accessibility and Device Independence. As discussed in the Scope document [Scope] there are many  aspects to Mobile Web Best Practices. At present, for example, the design and construction of many Web sites and pages make for a poor user experience when they are viewed on a mobile device. The quality of the user's Web experience via a mobile device depends significantly on the usability of Web sites, of browsers, and of the device itself. Although browser usability  and device usability are important (for reading, navigating, and interacting with content), this document focuses primarily on Best Practices for improving site usability. In future phases other aspects may be considered - e.g. Best Practices as applied to  adaptation and devices. Also in future phases the scope of the recommendations may be extended beyond "Traditional Web Browsing" into fields such as multimodal interaction. These recommendations are in part derived from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG]. As noted above, WCAG guidelines are supplementary to the Mobile Web Best Practices, whose scope is limited to matters that have a specific mobile relevance. This document builds on some of the concepts described by the Device Independence Working  Group (DIWG) in the Device Independence Principles [DIP]. The document discusses device and delivery channel characteristics, which the DIWG has named "Delivery Context"  [DCODI]. In addition, the document uses some terminology from DIWG's Glossary of Terms for  Device Independence [DIGLOSS]. The BPWG is developing a companion document describing techniques [Techniques] by which the Best Practice statements in this document can be implemented. The Best Practices have been written at a level of generality that allows them to be applicable across a range of markup languages. They have been written with enduring properties of mobile access to the Web in mind. While the factors identified in 3.7 Default Delivery Context, such as screen dimensions, will change over time, it seems likely that the distinguishing features of mobile access such as cost and difficulty of input will remain issues. This document may be reviewed from time to time. When necessary, an updated version will be released with clear documentation as to the changes that have been introduced. This section discusses the requirements of the Mobile Web Best Practice statements in section 5. The statement of requirements is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive or complete. Today, Many Web pages are laid out for presentation on desktop size displays, and exploit capabilities of desktop browsing software. Accessing such a Web page on a mobile device often results in a poor or unusable experience. Contributing factors include pages not being laid out as intended. Because of the limited screen size and the limited amount of material that is visible to the user, context and overview are lost. Because of the limited screen size, the subject matter of the page may require considerable scrolling to be visible, especially if the top of the page is occupied by images and navigation links. In these cases the user gets no immediate feedback as to whether their retrieval has resulted in the right content. It is particularly important in the mobile context to help the user create a mental image of the site. This can be assisted by adopting a consistent style and can be considerably diminished by an uneven style. Mobile device input is often difficult when compared with use of a desktop device equipped with a keyboard. Mobile devices often have only a very limited keypad, with small keys, and there is frequently no pointing device. One of the difficulties of the mobile Web is that URIs are very difficult to type. Lengthy URIs and those that contain a lot of punctuation are particularly difficult to type correctly.  Because of the limitations of screen and input, forms are hard to fill in. This is because navigation between fields may not occur in the expected order and because of the difficulty in typing into the fields. While many modern devices provide back buttons, some do not, and in some cases, where back functionality exists, users may not know how to invoke it. This means that it is often very hard to recover from errors, broken links and so on. Mobile networks can be slow compared with fixed data connections and often have a measurably higher latency. This can lead to long retrieval times, especially for lengthy content and for content that requires a lot of navigation between pages. Mobile data transfer often costs money. The fact that mobile devices frequently support only limited types of content means that a user may follow a link and retrieve information that is unusable on their device. Even if the content type can be interpreted by their device there is often an issue with the experience not being satisfactory - for example, larger images may only be viewable in small pieces and require considerable scrolling. Web pages can contain content that the user has not specifically requested - especially advertising and large images. In the mobile world this extra material contributes to poor usability and may add considerably to the cost of the retrieval. Mobile users typically have different interests to users of fixed or desktop devices. They are likely to have more immediate and goal-directed intentions than desktop Web users. Their intentions are often to find out specific pieces of information that are relevant to their context. An example of such a goal-directed application might be the user requiring specific information about schedules for a journey they are currently undertaking. Equally, mobile users are typically less interested in lengthy documents or in browsing. The ergonomics of the device are frequently unsuitable for reading lengthy documents, and users will often only access such information from mobile devices as a last resort, because more convenient access is not available. Developers of commercial Web sites should note that different commercial models are often at work when the Web is accessed from mobile devices as compared with desktop devices. For example, some mechanisms that are commonly used for presentation of advertising material (such as pop-ups, pop-unders and large banners) do not work well on small devices and are therefore contrary to Best Practice recommendations such as [CENTRAL_MEANING], [LARGE_GRAPHICS] and [POP_UPS]. It is not the intention of the MWI to limit or to restrict advertising; rather it is the intention that the user experience of the site as a whole, including advertising, if any, is as effective as possible. As noted above, the restrictions imposed by the keyboard and the screen typically require a different approach to page design than for desktop devices. As detailed in the Scope document [Scope], various other limitations may apply and these have an impact on the usability of the Web from a mobile device. Mobile browsers often do not support scripting or plug-ins, which means that the range of content that they support is limited. In many cases the user has no choice of browser and upgrading it is not possible. Some activities associated with rendering Web pages are computationally intensive - for example re-flowing pages, laying out tables, processing unnecessarily long and complex style sheets and handling invalid markup [T-MOB]. Mobile devices typically have quite limited processing power which means that page rendering may take a noticeable time to complete. As well as introducing a noticeable delay, such processing uses more power as does communication with the server. Many devices have limited memory available for pages and images, and exceeding their memory limitations results in incomplete display and can cause other problems. In discussing the limitations of mobile devices for delivery of Web content it is easy to lose sight of the fact that they are extremely popular and very common. This popularity largely stems at present from them being: personal personalizable portable connected and increasingly multi-functional beyond their original purpose of voice communications. In addition to these factors, the advantages of mobile devices will increasingly include: location awareness one-handed operation always on universal alerting device By way of illustration of some of these factors: the Web can go where you go. You do not have to remember to do something on the Web when you get back to your computer. You can do it immediately, within the context that made you want to use the Web in the first place. Moreover, with mobile devices appearing in all shapes and forms, and  with a growing variety of features like location technology, cameras, voice recognition, touch screens etc, the Web can reach a much wider audience, and at all times in all situations. It has the opportunity to reach into places where wires cannot go, to places previously unthinkable (e.g. providing medical info to mountain rescue scenes) and to accompany everyone as easily as they carry the time on their wristwatches. Finally, today, many more people have access to mobile devices than access to a desktop computer. This is likely to be very significant in developing countries, where Web-capable mobile devices may play as similar a role in deploying wide-spread Web access as the mobile phone has played for providing "plain old telephone service". The recommendations in this document are intended to improve the experience of the Web on mobile devices. While the recommendations are not specifically addressed at the desktop browsing experience, it must be understood that they are made in the context of wishing to work towards "One Web".  As discussed in the Scope document [Scope], One Web means making, as far as is reasonable, the same information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are using. However, it does not mean that exactly the same information is available in exactly the same representation across all devices. The context of mobile use, device capability variations, bandwidth issues and mobile network capabilities all affect the representation. Furthermore, some services and information are more suitable for and targeted at particular user contexts (see 5.1.1 Thematic Consistency of Resource Identified by a URI). Some services have a primarily mobile appeal (location based services, for example). Some have a primarily mobile appeal but have a complementary desktop aspect (for instance for complex configuration tasks). Still others have a primarily desktop appeal but a complementary mobile aspect (possibly for alerting). Finally there will remain some Web applications that have a primarily desktop appeal (lengthy reference material, rich images, for example). It is likely that application designers and service providers will wish to provide the best possible experience in the context in which their service has the most appeal. However, while services may be most appropriately experienced in one context or another, it is considered best practice to provide as reasonable experience as is possible given device limitations and not to exclude access from any particular class of device, except where this is necessary because of device limitations. From the perspective of this document this means that services should be available as some variant of HTML over HTTP (see 3.7 Default Delivery Context). The widely varying characteristics of mobile devices can make it difficult for a Web site to provide an acceptable user experience across a significant range of devices. For example different devices support different markup features and different screen sizes may demand different sized images. Consequently, it is very common when delivering content to mobile devices to vary the details of the markup, format of images, image sizes, color depths and so on to suit the characteristics of the device in question. The process of altering content to enhance the user experience on particular devices is referred to as Content Adaptation. We do not describe adaptation in detail in this document. For a more detailed description, readers are referred to the Device Independence Principles [DIP]. In addition, the sister group of the Best Practices Working Group, the Device Description Working Group, is currently defining requirements for a repository of mobile device characteristics that are relevant to content adaptation. There are a number of different implementation models for content adaptation. On the one hand, adaptation may be quite simple and consist of determining the device type and choosing the most appropriate set of previously prepared content to match the device characteristics. At the other extreme it may be carried out in a completely dynamic way, with content formatted at the time of retrieval, taking into account not only statically determined properties, such as screen dimension, but also dynamically determined properties, such as the temporary attachment of a fully featured keyboard.  Adaptation can be carried out in a number of different points in the delivery of content to the device [DCODI]: Whatever the adaptation model at work, the process of adaptation should not diminish accessibility. In phase 1 (See 1.4.1 Phasing) it is assumed that content adaptation, if any, is carried out Server Side. Future phases may consider the implications of content adaptation elsewhere, especially the issues concerning the granting of authority to third parties to carry out adaptation, prohibiting adaptation and so on. Later phases may also address multiple adaptation - i.e. the possibility that adaptation can be applied at more than one point and that In-Network adaptation may occur more than once. It is also assumed that it is possible to create a site that is consistent with the Best Practice recommendations without carrying out adaptation at all. However it is likely that a more sophisticated and enhanced user experience will be achieved if adaptation is used. Providing variations on the user experience that are appropriate in different cases requires the content provider to know a significant amount about the characteristics of the device, the properties of the browser in use and the transparency of the network connection to the device. For simple sites that present an interface which is similar across a broad range of contexts the need for such information is diminished when compared with a sophisticated site that has an optimized navigation structure, presents different size images or carries out other adaptations to suit the particular delivery context. There are several methods by which a content provider can discover information about the delivery context, such as  CC/PP, UAPROF, CSS Media Queries and various outputs of the Device Independence Working Group. The companion Techniques [Techniques] document describes these methods. In the interests of "One Web" (see 3.1 One Web) considerations, the content provider may choose to allow the user to select from broad categories such as mobile or desktop presentation, where these are distinguished in the application. If the presentation option has been determined automatically, the content provider may choose to allow the user to override the automatic determination. Where a choice of presentations is available, it is good practice to record the user's preferences and to allow them to be changed. Given an appropriate server environment, it is unlikely that the content provider will be unable to find out anything about the delivery context. However this can happen, either because details of the delivery context are not available in sufficient detail or because the server does not provide the ability to inspect and act on the information provided. In this case a "reasonable default experience" should be provided. The details of the default experience depend upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the geographic region in which the service is offered and the primary intention of the service (e.g. considering whether the service is primarily desktop focused vs. primarily mobile focused). In order to allow content providers to share a consistent view of a default mobile experience the BPWG has defined the Default Delivery Context. This allows providers to create appropriate experiences in the absence of adaptation and provides a baseline experience where adaptation is used. The Default Delivery Context has been determined by the BPWG as being the minimum delivery context specification necessary for a reasonable experience of the Web. It is recognized that devices that do not meet this specification can provide a reasonable experience of other non-Web services. It is also recognized that this specification is made against the background of demographic, cultural and economic assumptions. Content providers may choose to provide services that demand a different or lower delivery context specification, but should try to provide an experience that exploits the capabilities of the Default Delivery Context in order to provide the best possible experience for that context. It is stressed that many devices exceed the capabilities defined by the DDC. Content providers are encouraged not to diminish the user experience on those devices by developing only to the DDC specification, and are encouraged to adapt their content, where appropriate, to exploit the capabilities of the actual device. In summary, the purpose of defining the DDC is to support the following rules: If an adaptation process is used, then information that is known about the actual Delivery Context should (see 5.1.2 Exploit Device Capabilities) be used to vary the delivered content to make it more suitable for that specific Delivery Context or to provide an enhanced user experience. If the delivered content does not result from an adaptation process - e.g. the content is statically defined as HTML stored in files, or the details of the Delivery Context cannot adequately be determined, then the delivered content should be suitable for the Default Delivery Context and should comply with the Best Practice statements. The Default Delivery Context is defined as follows: 120 pixels, minimum. XHTML Basic 1.1 [XHTML-Basic] delivered with content type application/xhtml+xml. UTF-8 [UTF-8]. JPEG. GIF 89a. 20 kilobytes. 256 Colors, minimum. CSS Level 1 [CSS]. In addition, CSS Level 2 [CSS2] @media  rule together with the handheld and all media types (see CSS 2 Media Types). HTTP/1.0 [HTTP1.0] or more recent [HTTP1.1]. No support for client side scripting. The functional area that is addressed by the statements. One or more Best Practice statements, identified in the following way: An explanation of the significance of the statements under this heading.  A discussion of techniques and some suggestions as to how to implement. The BPWG is creating a separate document describing techniques [Techniques] in more detail. The aspects of the delivered content that an external validator could examine to assess conformance with the Best Practice statements. This section is not present for process related statements. In this section it is noted whether the statement is Machine Testable (Automated testing is possible) or Human Testable (Testing requires human assessment). Some Best Practices are partially machine testable, i.e. based on the result of an automated test, some human interaction may be required. In such cases both a Machine Testable and a Human Testable statement are present. Some Best Practice statements use words such as "minimize" and "avoid" which are intentionally non-prescriptive. This is in order to provide   guidance while leaving room to accommodate a wide variety of applications whose requirements cannot be anticipated. It also allows creativity and diversity within the same Best Practice framework. More prescriptive advice can be found in the Techniques document [Techniques]. Where appropriate, references to related WCAG points and other immediate references from the preceding text. The Best Practice statements are grouped under the following headings There are some general principles that underlie delivery to mobile devices.  A bookmark captured on one device should be usable on another, different type of device even if it does not yield exactly the same experience. If the page that was bookmarked is not appropriate for the device that is now using it,  an alternative that is suitable should be provided.  Just as in the desktop world, there are browsers that do not respect the intentions of the content provider. There are differences in interpretation between browsers and there are also deficiencies in implementation. By deficient we mean non-support of mandatory features of a relevant standard or recommendation and other bugs or errors in implementation.  Just as it is not the intention to recommend a least common denominator approach, neither is it the intention to recommend avoiding features that exhibit problems on some class of devices. It is also not the intention to suggest that content providers should restrict their support to certain device types. Content providers should aim to support as wide a range of device types as is practical. Any Web site should be tested in a range of browsers. Mobile browsers often show markedly different characteristics to desktop browsers. As well as assessing a site's suitability for display in reduced format, content providers are encouraged to test that the features they rely on work in actual devices.  Content providers should also test with specific features disabled, such as using text-only modes and with scripting disabled. Many manufacturers provide emulators for their device that can provide a convenient preliminary means of testing. However, in practice, many of the emulators behave in a different way to the devices they emulate. Consequently testing should be carried out in as wide a range of real devices and specific software versions as is practical. Because of the limitations in display and of input mechanisms, the possible absence of a pointing device and other constraints of mobile devices, care should be exercised in defining the structure and the navigation model of a Web site. allow and instead of  allow Provide the basic links on a single line.  The design should aim to provide a balance between having a large number of navigation links on a page and the need to navigate multiple links to reach content. Using the same navigation mechanisms across a service helps users orient themselves and allows them to identify navigation mechanisms more easily. At each target of the drill-down navigation an "up" link should be provided to allow the user to jump up an entire section. This relates to WCAG 13.4. Where there is no pointing device, assigning an access key (keyboard short cut) to a link can provide a convenient way for users to access the link and avoid navigating to the link by repeated pressing of the navigation key. Machine Test: Test for the presence of the accesskey attribute. This relates to WCAG 9.5. Users of mobile devices may suffer undue delay and cost as a result of following links. It is important to identify where a link leads so users can make an assessment of whether following it will be of interest to them. While it is unlikely that the cost in monetary terms of a particular user following a particular link can be specified, it should be possible to give an idea of the size of the resource (in bytes or in an abstract way, e.g. large file). Links to content that is in a different format or different language to that of the page the link is on (i.e. content that can only be interpreted by other applications or downloads) should be human signposted, so that users are not lead to download content that their device may not be able to use. However, bear in mind that some devices support the rendering of those formats by other applications once downloaded (e.g. music files). Additionally, users may wish to download content for later transfer to other devices altogether. So even if it is known that the user agent does not support a particular content type, that content should still be made available. For the Default Delivery Context all formats other than XHTML, GIF and JPG should be noted.  Human Test: Check for proper descriptions (e.g. no use of "Click here"). Machine Test: Check for links to non-HTML formats. Human Test: If present check whether there is information about the format of the target of the link. This relates to WCAG 11.3 and 13.1. Many mobile devices lack a pointing device and server-side image maps cannot be used on such devices. For the Default Delivery Context, or if a satisfactory image map cannot be displayed, use a list of links with descriptive text instead. IMAGE_MAPS Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that does not support client-side image maps and check the map element is not present. This relates to WCAG 1.2 and 9.1. Each of these activities is likely to cause the user confusion, or add cost and delay to their interaction. Some mobile devices use a separate window for input; this section does not refer to such windows. Many mobile devices cannot support more than one window and consequently, attempting to open one will have unpredictable results. While redirection is a commonly employed mechanism, it must be remembered that redirection usually requires a round-trip to the browser. This adds to delay on slow links; so use a maximum of one redirect per page and limit the number of pages that are redirected. POP_UPS Machine Test: Look for the target attribute on links and if present check to see if it has a value different from _self, _parent or _top. AUTO_REFRESH  Machine Test: Check whether meta http-equiv="refresh" content="&lt;the same URI&gt;" is used. REDIRECTION Machine Test: Check whether meta http-equiv="refresh" content="&lt;a different URI&gt;" is used. This relates to WCAG 7.4, 7.5 and 10.1. Each linked resource (images, style sheets and other objects) requires a separate request across the network. This may add significantly to the load time of the page in the mobile context. Minimize the number of images on a page and consolidate style information into a single sheet per page (see also 5.4.9 Style Sheets). Machine Test: Count the number of linked images, style sheets and other linked items. Human Test: Review whether a similar effect could be obtained using fewer links. Users in a mobile context are often looking for specific pieces of information, rather than browsing. Content providers should consider the likely context of use of information and, while providing the option to access all information, should offer appropriate information first. See also discussion under 2.4 User Goals and 3.1 One Web. The general prescription to use clear language is of particular importance for mobile delivery, where brevity and directness are generally more desirable than a discursive style. Writing content in the traditional journalistic "front loaded" style can assist users determining whether information is of interest to them and allow them to skip it more easily if it is not. Placing distinguishing information at the beginning of headings,  paragraphs, lists, etc. can also help the user contextualize when using devices with limited screen area. See also 5.3.4 Navigation Bars etc. (Extraneous material) for a discussion of making sure that the subject matter of the page is near the top. Mobile users often pay for bandwidth, so offering them content that is extraneous to their needs, especially advertising, costs them time and money and contributes to an unsatisfactory experience.  In general, the user's consent should be sought before initiating the download of content. Human Test: Examine content to determine if, given the subject matter, it is appropriate in a mobile context. This relates to WCAG 13.8 and 14.1. If pages are too big they may take an unduly long time to load. In addition, mobile devices typically have restrictions on the largest page they can accommodate. On the other hand, if pages are too short then the user will be required to make multiple requests to read the relevant information. This can lead to an unnecessary delay, since each request typically takes a measurable time to complete. The balance between pagination and scrolling is partly a matter of taste and partly a matter of necessity. Devices with severe memory restrictions can only have small pages delivered to them. Equally some devices offer a poor scrolling experience and a better page retrieval experience. Some studies [MF] have been carried out in this area to test for user preferences. Some of these indicate that users prefer scrolling to click-throughs and some indicate the contrary. More research is likely to be needed in this area.   For the Default Delivery Context assume the limits specified in 3.7 Default Delivery Context.  PAGE_SIZE_USABLE Machine Test: Measure the total size of the markup for a page; check that it does not exceed 10 kilobytes for the Default Delivery Context. Human Test: Check that the page is still usable (e.g. not cut in the middle of a sentence, just before the end of a section, and so on). PAGE_SIZE_LIMIT Machine Test: Measure the total size of markup and images for a page; check that it does not go over the allowed size for the device - 20 kilobytes for the Default Delivery Context. This relates to WCAG 12.3. The page should lay out so that simple repeated scrolling in the same direction (axis) allows the user to experience all its content. However some content (such as maps and other images) cannot be displayed without secondary scrolling.  If some element on the page requires secondary scrolling it must not cause the remainder of the page to require this. For example, if an object causes subsequent text to lay out with a significant margin to its left, then this text may not be visible once a user has scrolled past the object. Equally, if the presence of such an object causes text to render beyond the right boundary of the page then the user will be required to scroll to read each line of text. If it is not possible to avoid presenting images that are larger than the screen size, then consider providing these images on a separate page with a link back to the main content. In the Default Delivery Context assume a width of 120 pixels. SCROLLING Machine Test: Check for width attributes and width style properties wider than the screen size - for the Default Delivery Context, 120 pixels. Human Test: If it is wider than the screen size, check that the use case warrants it (e.g. maps). Browse URIs within a site with a mobile device and observe that on pages with elements that require secondary scrolling only those elements require it, and the rest of the page requires only primary scrolling. Many Web pages are designed with significant navigational and other elements at the top of or to the side of the page (e.g. Menu Bars, Breadcrumb Trails and Search Functions). This provides a convenient and well-understood navigational metaphor on large displays. However, on small displays this can result in the navigation appearing instead of the actual content of the page when the page is first retrieved.  Because it is important for the user to gain an idea of the content of the page on initial view, there should be a minimum amount of clutter preceding this - including navigation, decorative images, advertising and other material that is not central to the user's experience of the page. The user should not have to scroll significantly to find the primary content of the page. See also 5.3.1 Page Content for a discussion of how writing style can help the user identify meaning. Human test: Browse URIs within a site with a mobile device and observe that the most important/relevant information is conveyed first. This relates to WCAG 13.5. The popular mechanism of using a 1 pixel graphic for absolute positioning does not work on a variety of screens. GRAPHICS_FOR_SPACING Machine Test: Check for very small and/or transparent graphics. LARGE_GRAPHICS  Machine Test: Check dimensions of graphics. Mobile devices often do not have good color contrast and are often used in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. Hence information highlighted in color may not be visible to users. If color is used to indicate a feature then that feature should generally also be indicated in a way that is not color dependent. In particular, do not use blue or purple text, as this may be confused with hyperlinks, especially on devices that do not underline links. USE_OF_COLOR  Human Test: Browse the page in a monochrome environment. COLOR_CONTRAST Human Test: Browse the page under a strong light parallel to the screen. Machine Test: There are automatic tools to test color contrast. This relates to WCAG 2.1 and 2.2. Images that are used indiscriminately can lead to content that is hard to view, particularly with the limited contrast often found on mobile devices and in the hostile viewing conditions in which mobile devices are frequently used. Before using background images, consider carefully your objectives for doing so and try to use alternative techniques to achieve similar objectives. If you use a background image ensure that the content is readable with and without the background image for devices that do not support them. Machine Test: Test for the presence of a background image. Human Test: Test readability both on devices that support them and devices that do not. Provide a descriptive title for the page to allow easy identification. Keep the title short to reduce page weight, and bear in mind that it may be truncated. Many mobile browsers do not display the title of a page. Where the title is displayed the available space may be limited. The device may use the page title as the default label for bookmarks. Again, space may be limited, so use it to help identify the content and not for other purposes. Machine Test: Test for presence of the title element. Human Test: Test that the title is descriptive of content. Many mobile devices do not support frames. In addition, frames are recognized as being generally problematic.  Machine Test: Test for presence of frame related elements -  check for frameset and iframe elements. See  http://www.w3.org/TR/xframes/#s_intro for a discussion of problems with frames. It is good practice for all but the simplest documents to indicate their structure through headings and sub-headings. Using structural markup, rather than formatting effects, allows easier adaptation of content where it needs to be divided into several pages, as well as potentially facilitating access to the sections of the document that a user is interested in. Where headings are used they should be used in accordance with the specification, i.e. they should be properly nested according to their level. Structural markup must not be used solely to create a font effect (see also 5.4.3 Structural Elements). Markup languages like HMTL contain many constructs to indicate structure. Tables do not work well on limited size screens and may result in the user having to scroll horizontally to read them. Putting navigational links into tables may result in the user having both to scroll horizontally and vertically to see possible navigational choices. TABLES_SUPPORT Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that does not support tables and check the table element is not present. Machine Test: Check that there are no nested tables. TABLES_LAYOUT Machine Test: Check that no column or row in a table is empty or contains only a 1x1 transparent GIF. Machine Test: If there is a table element, check to see whether there is rendered content outside the element. If there is not then it is likely that the table is being used for layout. This relates to WCAG 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5 and 5.6. A non-text item is defined by Non-text content in the WAI Glossary [WAIGlossary]. Downloading images to a mobiledevice adds to the time to display an image and the cost of displaying the page. Making the page readable in text-only mode can help the user assess its usefulness before images arrive. Many mobile devices do not support embedded objects or script and in many cases it is not possible for users to load plug-ins to add support. Content must be designed with this in mind.  Even where a device does support scripting, do not use it unless there is no other way of accomplishing your objectives. Scripting increases power consumption and so decreases battery life. Design pages so that they are useful when rendered as text-only. See also 5.1.4 Testing. Always use features of the markup designed to support alternate rendering such as the longdesc and alt attributes in XHTML. Use only features from the markup that are known to be supported by the device in question. Avoid things like CSS image replacement and pictures of words. If scripting is used, do not use onmouse and onkey triggers, use onclick. NON-TEXT_ALTERNATIVES Machine Test: Test for presence of alt attribute on images and text content on objects. Human Test: Check the relevance of the meaning of the content of alt attributes. OBJECTS_OR_SCRIPT Machine Test: Test for the presence of object or script elements in content delivered to a device that does not support them and if present carry out the Human Test below. Human Test: If present, test that the user experience is acceptable. This relates to WCAG 1.1, 3.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 and 9.2. Note that this recommendation contrasts with 5.4.8 Measures, which recommends using relative measures where possible. IMAGES_SPECIFY_SIZE Machine Test: Test for presence of width and height attributes on img elements. IMAGES_RESIZING  Machine Test: Check width and height attributes are equal to image dimensions. If the page markup is invalid this will result in unpredictable and possibly incomplete presentation.  Machine Test: Validate documents. This relates to WCAG 3.2, 11.1 and 11.2.  See http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/#validators.  Avoiding pixel and absolute measures allows the browser to adapt content to fit the display. An exception to rule is where an image has been specifically sized for a particular display (see 5.4.6 Image Size). In this case references to the image in markup may specify the exact dimensions of the image in pixels, in order to help the browser to flow the page and avoid re-flowing it after the page has been retrieved. Devices may realize the intentions of authors more accurately if margins, borders and padding are specified in pixels. Use percentage and relative measures such as em, ex, bolder, larger and thick. Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that supports relative measures correctly and check the values of font-size are not absolute or pixels. Style information may be contained in an externally linked style sheet or, in HTML, may be contained either in a style element or in a style attribute on specific elements. Mobile devices offer varying support for style sheets. Some provide full implementations, including caching of external style sheets; some do not cache external style sheets; some do not support the style element; some implementations do not support more than one style sheet and some do not support style sheets at all. If style sheets are turned off or not supported, content will be rendered in document order, so it is important that the content makes sense when read in document order. Optimize style information so that only styles that are used are included. When creating style sheets, take advantage of the CSS media types (these may be used both in the CSS @media rule and in the media attribute of the link element) to specify styles that apply to handheld rendering. The CSS Media types that apply are "handheld" and "all". If handheld rendering is not specified, browsers may download other style sheets even if they are identified as applicable to non-handheld rendering STYLE_SHEETS_USE Machine Test: Send a request to the site with a device that supports CSS and check that style sheets are used and that the page does not use formatting tags (e.g. font). STYLE_SHEETS_SUPPORT  Human Test: Disable style sheets and check that the page is still readable.  STYLE_SHEETS_SIZE Machine Test: Check that the elements in a style sheet are used in at least one of the pages that reference it. This relates to WCAG 3.3 and 6.1 Content which is marked up in languages such as XML can often be made smaller while preserving exactly the same semantics merely by removal of redundant white space (i.e. spaces and new lines). Marking fonts, colors and other stylistic effects in-line can cause considerably larger page sizes when compared with using logical markup, and use of the HTML class attribute for application of style (see also 5.4.9 Style Sheets). If "pretty printing" is an important part of the authoring process, then try to arrange that redundant white space is stripped when serving a page. Use of structural markup (see 5.4.3 Structural Elements) contributes to minimizing the size of the markup on a page, as does centralizing the style descriptions using CSS [CSS]. Machine Test: Count the number of non-significant white space characters in the document. Transferring content that a device cannot display wastes users' time and money. A device may express a preference for formats. In this case it is good practice to respect the device's preference, as it may have a fuller implementation of those formats. There are problems with using any one approach to the exclusion of the others. Some issues that have been noted by the BPWG in this context are: Some devices do not supply accept headers; Some devices mis-state their capabilities; Some operator gateways supplement the accept headers to include formats that they adapt; User agent headers do not always uniquely identify the device; UAProf information may not be available or may be incomplete. CONTENT_FORMAT_SUPPORT Machine Test: Check MIME types of content with various devices. CONTENT_FORMAT_PREFERRED  Machine Test: Check MIME types of content with various devices and check that the preferred format is sent or that the format is compatible with the Default Delivery Context. As in the previous section, content should not be sent to a device if it can not use it. Machine Test: Check that the encoding is declared in some way and is supported. The content type may be declared in one or more of the following ways: The Content-Type HTTP header, the XML declaration for XML-based content, the CSS @charset rules for CSS, the Content-Type Meta element for HTML content. A "retry" link to attempt the relevant part of the transaction again (note that this may not be equivalent to a page "refresh"); Enter an extraneous URI, known not to represent an actual resource on the site, and check that a HTTP 404 error response is accompanied by a page whose markup is appropriate for the requesting device, or the default context. Cookies are frequently used to carry out session management, to identify users and to store user preferences. Many mobile devices do not implement cookies or offer only an incomplete implementation. In addition, some gateways strip cookies and others simulate cookies on behalf of mobile devices.  Test that cookies are supported by the device on its current access path. If they are not supported, use URI decoration for session management, being careful not to exceed the device's maximum length for such strings. Some gateways provide user identification without setting cookies.  Machine Test: Check that an alternative to cookies is used for session management when they are not available. Set expiry times in a way that is appropriate to your application. Consider using Cache-Control: public to allow sharing of pages between devices, Cache-Control: private to allow re-use but only by the requesting device and Cache-Control: nocache to prevent caching. Machine Test: Check for the presence of cache headers on the HTTP response. Mobile devices often have few fonts and limited support for font sizes and effects (bold, italic etc.) As a result of this, the use of font size, face or effect, for example to highlight an answer or a stressed word, may not achieve the desired effect. See also 5.4.3 Structural Elements. For the Default Delivery Context do not use font related styling. Machine Test: Check for the presence of font related styling in an environment that does not support it. Human Test: If present, ensure that the author's intentions remain clear. This section contains statements relating to user input. This is typically more restrictive on mobile devices than on desktop computers (and often a lot more restrictive). For example, mobile devices may lack pointing devices and often do not have a standard keyboard for text entry. Given the typical input limitations of a mobile device, the interface must as far as possible minimize user input. Where possible, use selection lists, radio buttons and other controls that do not require typing. Some markup languages allow the specification of an input mode, which is particularly useful in cases where user input is to be restricted, for example to numeric only. It is anticipated that XHTML-Basic [XHTML-Basic] will support this functionality in the future. There are a number of techniques available for this, including: Where possible use previous entries as defaults. Make it possible to select items using navigation keys and/or numeric input. AVOID_FREE_TEXT  Machine Test: Check whether input type="text" and textarea are used.  Human Test: If one of them is used, check whether it can be replaced by a pre-determined entry. PROVIDE_DEFAULTS  Machine Test: Check if there is a pre-selected value in controls (selected or checked attribute set).   Human Test: If not, check if there could be sensible pre-selection in the context (e.g. most common choice). DEFAULT_INPUT_MODE Machine Test: Send a request with a device known to support the inputmode attribute and if the response is in a language that supports this attribute, check that it is present on input type="text" and textarea elements. This relates to WCAG 10.4. It is important that as the user navigates through the page the various fields and objects are presented in a logical order, especially as many of them will not be visible at the same time as the focus item. Use document order to control layout and tab order. Machine Test: Check that there are no tabindex attributes or layout effects that affect the order of presentation.  If there are tabindex attributes check that all controls have a tab index and that they are used consistently. Human Test: If there are either tabindex attributes or layout effects that might affect the order of presentation, then check that the order is usable. This means use the label element in HTML, or its equivalent in other languages. Make sure that where the label goes is consistent and close to the form control so re-flowing or adapting the content intelligently will always recognize label controls and keep them together.  Machine Test: Check if the label element is used in forms.   Human Test: Check whether the labels are properly positioned with regard to the controls. This relates to WCAG 10.2 and 12.4.  The Best Practice statements are intended to be capable of  having conformance statements constructed around them in support of the mobileOK trustmark and for other purposes. Work on the mobileOK trustmark will develop specific recommended requirements for a trustmark, which will be based on some profile, or subset, of the  Statements in this document. All of the Best Practice statements have a fragment identifier to allow formal reference to them and allow the construction of compliance claims that refer to them. This specification may be compatible with other specifications that describe a different set of requirements for content, insofar as such requirements do not conflict with the current specification. The Best Practice statements have been assembled by the BPWG from a number of sources. Primary among those are: Various BPWG group meetings and discussions  The editors acknowledge significant written contributions from: Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0 Basic Guidelines W3C Recommendation 29 July 2008 Abstract Status of this Document Table of Contents List of Best Practices 1 Introduction 2 Requirements 3 Delivery Context 4 Structure of Best Practice Statements 5 Best Practice Statements 6 Conformance and mobileOK  A Sources (Non-Normative) B Related Reading (Non-Normative) C Acknowledgements (Non-Normative) D References (Non-Normative) Appendices 1.1 Purpose of the Document 1.2 How the Best Practices are Organized 1.3 Audience 1.4 Scope 1.5 Relationship to other Best Practices and recommendations 1.6 Longevity and Versioning 2.1 Presentation Issues 2.2 Input 2.3 Bandwidth and Cost 2.4 User Goals 2.5 Advertising 2.6 Device Limitations 2.7 Advantages 3.1 One Web 3.2 Background to Adaptation 3.3 Adaptation Implementation Model 3.4 Assumptions about Adaptation 3.5 Establishing Context 3.6 Choice of User Experience 3.7 Default Delivery Context 5.1 Overall Behavior 5.2 Navigation and Links 5.3 Page Layout and Content 5.4 Page Definition 5.5 User Input 6.1 Classes of Products 6.2 Extensibility D.1 MWI References D.2 Sources D.3 Device Independence D.4 Web, Protocols and Languages D.5 Other References 1.4.1 Phasing 5.1.1 Thematic Consistency of Resource Identified by a URI 5.1.2 Exploit Device Capabilities 5.1.3 Work around Deficient Implementations 5.1.4 Testing 5.2.1 URIs of Site Entry Points 5.2.2 Navigation Bar 5.2.3 Balanced Structure 5.2.4 Navigation Mechanisms 5.2.5 Access Keys 5.2.6 Link Target Identification 5.2.7 Image Maps 5.2.8 Refreshing, Redirection and Spawned Windows 5.2.9 Externally Linked Resources 5.3.1 Page Content 5.3.2 Page Size 5.3.3 Scrolling 5.3.4 Navigation Bars etc. (Extraneous material) 5.3.5 Graphics 5.3.6 Color 5.3.7 Background Images 5.4.1 Title 5.4.2 Frames 5.4.3 Structural Elements 5.4.4 Tables 5.4.5 Non-Text Items 5.4.6 Image Size 5.4.7 Valid Markup 5.4.8 Measures 5.4.9 Style Sheets 5.4.10 Minimize 5.4.11 Content Types 5.4.12 Character Encoding 5.4.13 Error Messages 5.4.14 Cookies 5.4.15 Cache Headers 5.4.16 Fonts 5.5.1 Input 5.5.2 Tab Order 5.5.3 Labels for Form Controls 5.1.1.1 What it means 5.1.2.1 What it means 5.1.3.1 What it means 5.1.4.1 What it means 5.1.4.2 How to do it 5.2.1.1 What it means 5.2.1.2 How to do it 5.2.2.1 What it means 5.2.2.2 How to do it 5.2.3.1 What it means 5.2.4.1 What it means 5.2.4.2 How to do it 5.2.4.3 References 5.2.5.1 What it means 5.2.5.2 What to test 5.2.5.3 References 5.2.6.1 What it means 5.2.6.2 How to do it 5.2.6.3 What to test 5.2.6.4 References 5.2.7.1 What it means 5.2.7.2 How to do it 5.2.7.3 What to test 5.2.7.4 References 5.2.8.1 What it means 5.2.8.2 What to test 5.2.8.3 References 5.2.9.1 What it means 5.2.9.2 How to do it 5.2.9.3 What to test 5.3.1.1 What it means 5.3.1.2 What to test 5.3.1.3 References 5.3.2.1 What it means 5.3.2.2 How to do it 5.3.2.3 What to test 5.3.2.4 References 5.3.3.1 What it means 5.3.3.2 How to do it 5.3.3.3 What to test 5.3.4.1 What it means 5.3.4.2 How to do it 5.3.4.3 What to test 5.3.4.4 References 5.3.5.1 What it means 5.3.5.2 What to test 5.3.6.1 What it means 5.3.6.2 What to test 5.3.6.3 References 5.3.7.1 What it means 5.3.7.2 What to test 5.4.1.1 What it means 5.4.1.2 What to test 5.4.2.1 What it means 5.4.2.2 What to test 5.4.2.3 References 5.4.3.1 What it means 5.4.3.2 How to do it 5.4.4.1 What it means 5.4.4.2 What to test 5.4.4.3 References 5.4.5.1 What it means 5.4.5.2 How to do it 5.4.5.3 What to test 5.4.5.4 References 5.4.6.1 What it means 5.4.6.2 What to test 5.4.7.1 What it means 5.4.7.2 What to test 5.4.7.3 References 5.4.8.1 What it means 5.4.8.2 How to do it 5.4.8.3 What to test 5.4.9.1 What it means 5.4.9.2 How to do it 5.4.9.3 What to test 5.4.9.4 References 5.4.10.1 What it means 5.4.10.2 How to do it 5.4.10.3 What to test 5.4.11.1 What it means 5.4.11.2 How to do it 5.4.11.3 What to test 5.4.12.1 What it means 5.4.12.3 What to test 5.4.12.4 References 5.4.13.1 What it means 5.4.13.2 How to do it 5.4.13.3 What to test 5.4.14.1 What it means 5.4.14.2 How to do it 5.4.14.3 What to test 5.4.15.1 What it means 5.4.15.2 How to do it 5.4.15.3 What to test 5.4.15.4 References 5.4.16.1 What it means 5.4.16.2 How to do it 5.4.16.3 What to test 5.5.1.1 What it means 5.5.1.2 How to do it 5.5.1.3 What to test 5.5.1.4 References 5.5.2.1 What it means 5.5.2.2 How to do it 5.5.2.3 What to test 5.5.3.1 What it means 5.5.3.2 What to test 5.5.3.3 References "http://www.example.org/index.html" "http://example.org" "http://www.example.org/example.html" "http://example.org/example" This version: Latest version: Previous version: Editors: Jo Rabin, mTLD Mobile Top Level Domain (dotMobi) Charles McCathieNevile, Opera Software [Early Drafts] 120 pixels, minimum.

Some Best Practices are partially machine testable, i.e. based on the result of an automated test, some human interaction may be required. In such cases both a Machine Testable and a Human Testable statement are present.Some Best Practice statements use words such as "minimize" and "avoid" which are intentionally non-prescriptive. This is in order to provide   guidance while leaving room to accommodate a wide variety of applications whose requirements cannot be anticipated.

XForms is an XML application that represents the next generation of forms for the Web. By splitting traditional XHTML forms into three parts&mdash;XForms model, instance data, and user interface&mdash;it separates presentation from content, allows reuse, gives strong typing&mdash;reducing the number of round-trips to the server, as well as offering device independence and a reduced need for scripting. XForms is not a free-standing document type, but is intended to be integrated into other markup languages, such as XHTML or SVG. This document is a Recommendation of the W3C. This document supersedes XForms 1.0 Second Edition.  This document has been produced by the W3C Forms Working Group as part of the Forms Activity within the W3C Interaction Domain. The authors of this document are the Forms Working Group participants. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. Comments on this document are welcome. Please send them to the public mailing list www-forms-editor@w3.org. (archive). It is inappropriate to send discussion email to this address. Forms are an important part of the Web, and they continue to be the primary means for enabling interactive Web applications. Web applications and electronic commerce solutions have sparked the demand for better Web forms with richer interactions. XForms 1.0 is the response to this demand, and provides a new platform-independent markup language for online interaction between a person (through an XForms Processor) and another, usually remote, agent. XForms are the successor to HTML forms, and benefit from the lessons learned from HTML forms.  Further background information on XForms can be found at http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms.  This specification has been written with various types of readers in mind&mdash;in particular XForms authors and XForms implementors. We hope the specification will provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient, attractive and accessible documents without overexposing them to the XForms implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all they need to build conforming XForms Processors. The specification begins with a general presentation of XForms before specifying the technical details of the various XForms components.  The specification has been written with various modes of presentation in mind. In case of a discrepancy, the online electronic version is considered the authoritative version of the document.  This document uses the terms optional, required, recommended,  may, must, and should in accord with [RFC 2119].  The specification is organized into the following chapters:  An introduction to XForms. The introduction outlines the design principles and includes a brief tutorial on XForms.  XForms reference manual. The bulk of the reference manual consists of the specification of XForms. This reference defines XForms and how XForms Processors must interpret the various components in order to claim conformance.  Appendixes contain a normative description of XForms described in XML Schema, information on references, and other useful information.  Throughout this document, the following namespace prefixes and corresponding namespace identifiers are used:  xforms: The XForms namespace (http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms) 3.1 The XForms Namespacehtml: The XHTML namespace (http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml) [XHTML 1.0]xsd: The XML Schema namespace (http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema)[XML Schema part 1]xsi: The XML Schema for instances namespace (http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance)[XML Schema part 1]ev: The XML Events namespace (http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events)[XML Events]my: Any user defined namespace This is only a convention; any namespace prefix may be used in practice.

The following typesetting convention is used for non-normative commentary:  A gentle explanation or admonition to readers.  XForms has been designed on the basis of several years' experience with HTML forms. HTML Forms have formed the backbone of the e-commerce revolution, and having shown their worth, have also indicated numerous ways they could be improved. The primary difference when comparing XForms with HTML Forms, apart from XForms being in XML, is the separation of the data being collected from the markup of the controls collecting the individual values. By doing this, it not only makes XForms more tractable by making it clear what is being submitted where, it also eases reuse of forms, since the underlying essential part of a Form is no longer irretrievably bound to the page it is used in. A second major difference is that XForms, while designed to be integrated into XHTML, is no longer restricted only to be a part of that language, but may be integrated into any suitable markup language. XForms has striven to improve authoring, reuse, internationalization, accessibility, usability, and device independence. Here is a summary of the primary benefits of using XForms: Submitted data is strongly typed and can be checked using off-the-shelf tools. This speeds up form filling since it reduces the need for round trips to the server for validation. This obviates the need for custom server-side logic to marshal the submitted data to the application back-end. The received XML instance document can be directly validated and processed by the application back-end. This obviates duplication, and ensures that updating the validation rules as a result of a change in the underlying business logic does not require re-authoring validation constraints within the XForms application. This enables the XForms author to go beyond the basic set of constraints available from the back-end. Providing such additional constraints as part of the XForms Model enhances the overall usability of the resulting Web application. Using XML 1.0 for instance data ensures that the submitted data is internationalization ready. XForms separates content and presentation. User interface controls encapsulate all relevant metadata such as labels, thereby enhancing accessibility of the application when using different modalities. XForms user interface controls are generic and suited for device-independence. The high-level nature of the user interface controls, and the consequent intent-based authoring of the user interface makes it possible to re-target the user interaction to different devices. By defining XML-based declarative event handlers that cover common use cases, the majority of XForms documents can be statically analyzed, reducing the need for imperative scripts for event handlers. In the XForms approach, forms are comprised of a section that describes what the form does, called the XForms Model, and another section that describes how the form is to be presented.  Consider a simple electronic commerce form that might be rendered as follows: It is clear that we are collecting a value that represents whether cash or credit card is being used, and if a credit card, its number and expiration date. This can be represented in the XForms model element, which in XHTML would typically be contained within the head section:  This simply says that we are collecting three pieces of information (note that we have as yet not said anything about their types), and that they will be submitted using the URL in the action attribute. XForms 1.0 defines a device-neutral, platform-independent set of form controls suitable for general-purpose use. The controls are bound to the XForms Model via the XForms binding mechanism, in this simple case using the ref attribute on the controls. In XHTML, this markup would typically appear within the body section (note that we have intentionally defaulted the XForms namespace prefix here): Notice the following features of this design: The user interface is not hard-coded to use radio buttons. Different devices (such as voice browsers) can render the concept of "select one" as appropriate. Form controls always have labels directly associated with them as child elements&mdash;this is a key feature designed to enhance accessibility. There is no need for an enclosing form element, as in HTML. (See 2.4 Multiple Forms per Document for details on how to author multiple forms per document) Markup for specifying form controls has been simplified in comparison with HTML forms.  The fact that you can bind form controls to the model like this simplifies integrating XForms into other host languages, since any form control markup may be used to bind to the model. The XForms Processor can directly submit the data collected as XML. In the example, the submitted data would look like this: XForms processing keeps track of the state of the partially filled form through this instance data. Initial values for the instance data may be provided or left empty as in the example. Element instance essentially holds a skeleton XML document that gets updated as the user fills out the form. It gives the author full control on the structure of the submitted XML data, including namespace information. When the form is submitted, the instance data is serialized as an XML document. Here is an alternative version of the earlier example: In this case the submitted data would look like this: This design has features worth calling out: There is complete flexibility in the structure of the XML instance data, including the use of attributes. Notice that XML namespaces are used, and that a wrapper element of the author's choosing contains the instance data. Empty elements number and expiry serve as place-holders in the XML structure, and will be filled in with form data provided by the user. An initial value ("cc") for the form control is provided through the instance data, in this case an attribute method. In the submitted XML, this initial value will be replaced by the user input, if the user changes the form control displaying that data. To connect this instance data with form controls, the ref attributes on the form controls need to be changed to point to the proper part of the instance data, using binding expressions: Binding expressions are based on XPath [XPath 1.0], including the use of the @ character to refer to attributes, as seen here. Note that for illustrative purposes, the first two expressions make use of the XPath context node, which defaults to the top-level element (here my:payment). The third expression shows an absolute path. XForms allows data to be checked for validity as the form is being filled. In the absence of specific information about the types of values being collected, all values are returned as strings, but it is possible to assign types to values in the instance data. In this example, number should accept digits only, and should have between 14 and 18 digits and expiry should accept only valid month/date combinations. Furthermore, the credit card information form controls for number and expiry are only relevant if the "cc" option is chosen for method, but are required in that case. By specifying an additional component, model item properties, authors can include rich declarative validation information in forms. Such information can be taken from XML Schemas as well as XForms-specific additions, such as relevant. Such properties appear on bind elements, while Schema constraints are expressed in an XML Schema fragment, either inline or external. For example:  In the above example, the relevant expression uses absolute XPath notation (beginning with /) because the evaluation context nodes for computed expressions are determined by the bind ref binding expression (see 7.4 Evaluation Context), and so any relative node path in the first bind relevant above would be relative to /my:payment/my:number XForms processing places no limits on the number of individual forms that can be placed in a single containing document. When a single document contains multiple forms, each form needs a separate model element, each with an id attribute so that they can be referenced from elsewhere in the containing document. In addition, form controls should specify which model element contains the instance data to which they bind. This is accomplished through a model attribute that is part of the binding attributes. If no model attribute is specified on the binding element, the nearest ancestor binding element's model attribute is used, and failing that, the first XForms Model in document order is used. This technique is called 'scoped resolution', and is used frequently in XForms. The next example adds an opinion poll to our electronic commerce form. Additionally, the following markup would appear in the body section of the document: The main difference here is the use of model="poll", which identifies the instance. Note that submit refers to the submission element by ID and does not require binding attributes.  More XForms examples can be found in G Complete XForms Examples. XForms 1.0 is an application of XML [XML 1.0] and has been designed for use within other XML vocabularies&mdash;in particular within a future version of XHTML [XHTML 1.0]. XForms always requires such a host language. This chapter discusses the structure of XForms that allow XForms to be used with other document types. The XForms namespace has the URI: http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms.  XForms Processors must use the XML namespaces mechanism [XML Names] to recognize elements and attributes from this namespace. The Common Attribute Collection applies to every element in the XForms namespace. The optional id attribute of type xsd:ID assigns an identity to the containing element. Foreign attributes are allowed on all XForms elements. The Linking Attributes Collection applies to XForms elements which include a link to a remote resource. The src attribute assigns a URI to be automatically retrieved. Since linking attribute URIs are defined in terms of the XML Schema datatype xsd:anyURI, the same internationalization benefits and white space cautions apply as discussed in [XML Schema part 2]. Behavior of relative URIs in links is determined by the host language, although [XML Base] processing is strongly recommended. The Forms Working Group is tracking with the HTML Working Group on a method of describing link structures. Binding expression interpreted as XPath. This attribute has no meaning when a bind attribute is present. Optional XForms Model selector. Specifies the ID of an XForms Model to be associated with this binding element. This attribute has no meaning for the current binding element when a bind attribute is present. Rules for determining the context XForms Model are located at 7.4 Evaluation Context. Reference to a bind element. When the Single-Node Binding is required,  one of ref or bind is required. When bind is used, the node is determined by the referenced bind. See 4.7.2 References to Elements within a bind Element for details on selecting an identified bind that is iterated by one or more containing bind elements. It is an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event) if the XForms Processor encounters a model IDREF value that refers to an ID not on a model element, or a bind IDREF value that refers to an ID not on a bind element. First-node rule: When a Single-Node Binding attribute selects a node-set of size &gt; 1, the first node in the node-set, based on document order, is used. Binding expression interpreted as XPath. This attribute has no meaning when a bind attribute is present. Optional XForms Model selector. Specifies the ID of an XForms Model to be associated with this binding element. This attribute has no meaning for the current binding element when a bind attribute is present. Rules for determining the context XForms Model are located at 7.4 Evaluation Context. Reference to a bind element. When the Node-Set Binding is required,  one of nodeset or bind is required. When bind is used, the node-set is determined by the referenced bind.	See 4.7.2 References to Elements within a bind Element for details on selecting an identified bind that is iterated by one or more containing bind elements. It is an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event) if the XForms Processor encounters a model IDREF value that refers to an id not on a model element, or a bind IDREF value that refers to an id not on a bind element. This collection contains one attribute for each model item property, with an attribute name exactly matching the name of the model item property, as defined in 6.1 Model Item Property Definitions. The XForms Core Module defines the major structural elements of XForms, intended for inclusion in a containing document. The elements and attributes included in this module are: Elements defined in the XForms Actions module, when that module is included, are also allowed in the content model of model and submission, as shown above. Within the containing document, these structural elements are typically not rendered. The XForms Processor must ignore any foreign-namespaced attributes that are unrecognized, and must process unrecognized foreign-namespaced elements according to the 3.4 The XForms MustUnderstand Module rules. Note that the presence of foreign namespaced elements is subject to the definition of the containing document profile.  This element represents a form definition and is used as a container for elements that define the XForms Model. No restriction is placed on how many model elements may exist within a containing document. Common Attributes: Common, Events Attributes from XML Events are allowed on this element to facilitate creating observers. This element is not an XForms Action, and has no predefined behavior event-based behavior. Special Attributes: Optional space-separated list of XPath extension functions (represented by QNames) required by this XForms Model. Guidance on the use of this attribute is at 7.12 Extension Functions. Optional list of xsd:anyURI links to XML Schema documents outside this model element. The XForms Processor must process all Schemas listed in this attribute. Within each XForms Model, there is a limit of one Schema per namespace declaration, including inline and linked Schemas. The schema list may include URI fragments referring to elements located elsewhere in the containing document; e.g. "#myschema". Optional attribute with a default value of empty string and legal values defined by the datatype xforms:versionList.  Examples are "1.0" and "1.0 1.1". If one or more versions are indicated by this attribute on the default model, then an XForms Processor must support at least one of the listed language versions of XForms. Otherwise, the XForms Processor must terminate processing after dispatching the event xforms-version-exception to the default model.  If the XForms Processor supports more than one language version indicated by the version setting on the default model or if the version setting on the default model is empty string (whether specified or by default), then the XForms Processor may execute the XForms content using any language conformance level available to it.  If any non-default model has a version setting that is incompatible with the language version selected by the XForms Processor, or if any model contains an illegal version attribute value, then the XForms Processor must terminate processing after dispatching the event xforms-version-exception to the default model.  The version attribute is optional to implement, but future versions of XForms are expected to support it, so implementation support is strongly encouraged. This example shows a simple usage of model, with the XForms namespace defaulted: This optional element contains or references initial instance data. Common Attributes: Common Special Attributes: Optional link to externally defined initial instance data. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-link-exception Event). If both an attribute and inline content are provided, the linked version takes precedence as described at 4.2.1 The xforms-model-construct Event. If the initial instance data is given by a link, then the instance data is formed by creating an XPath data model of the linked resource. If the initial instance data is given by inline content, then instance data is obtained by first creating a detached copy of the inline content (including namespaces inherited from the enveloping ancestors), then creating an XPath data model over the detached copy. The detached copy must consist of content that would be well-formed XML if it existed in a separate document. Note that this restricts the element content of instance to a single child element. In XForms 1.1, a new exception event will be issued. All data relevant to the XPath data model must be preserved during processing and submission, including processing instructions, comment nodes and all whitespace. XForms authors who need additional control over the serialization of namespace nodes can use the includenamespaceprefixes attribute on the submission element. This element represents declarative instructions on what to submit, and how. Details of submit processing are described at 11  Submit. Common Attributes: Common Special Attributes: Optional reference to a bind element. When present, the binding reference on this attribute is used in preference to any binding reference from the ref attribute. Optional selector binding expression enabling submission of a portion of the instance data. The selected node, and all descendants, are selected for submission. The default value is "/". Required attribute specifying the protocol to be used to transmit the serialized instance data. There is no default value. Optional attribute specifying the version of XML to be serialized. Optional attribute specifying whether the serializer should add extra white space nodes for readability. Optional attribute specifying the mediatype for XML instance serialization. Authors should ensure that the type specified is compatible with application/xml.  Optional attribute specifying an encoding for serialization. Optional attribute specifying whether to omit the XML declaration on the serialized instance data. Optional attribute specifying whether to include a standalone declaration in the serialized XML. Optional attribute specifying element names to be serialized with CDATA sections. Optional attribute specifying how the information returned after submit should be applied. In the absence of this attribute, "all" is assumed. Optional attribute specifying the separator character between name/value pairs in urlencoding. The default value is ';'. Optional attribute providing control over namespace serialization. If absent, all namespace nodes present in the instance data are considered for serialization. If present, specifies list of namespace prefixes to consider for serialization, in addition to those visibly utilized. As in [Exc-C14N], the special value #default specifies the default namespace. The following examples show how various options on element submission can affect serialization as application/xml. Given the following XForms fragment: Note that the includenamespaceprefixes attribute is not present, which causes all namespace nodes to be serialized, resulting in the following serialized instance data: In particular, note that the XForms namespace has been serialized. To prevent this example from including the unneeded XForms namespace while maintaining the needed my prefix, includenamespaceprefixes="my" must be added to the submission element. When this attribute is present, the author takes responsibility to list all namespace prefixes not visibly utilized by the submitted instance data. The following attributes correspond (in spelling, processing, and default values) to attributes on the output element of [XSLT 1.0], with the exception of using xsd:boolean to replace "yes"|"no": versionindentencodingomit-xml-declarationcdata-section-elements The following XSLT attributes have no counterpart in XForms: doctype-systemdoctype-public Elements defined in the XForms Actions module, when that module is included, are also allowed in the content model of submission. Common Attributes: Common, Model Item Properties (Optional) Special Attributes: An optional attribute containing  a model binding expression that selects the set of nodes on which this bind operates. See 7.4 Evaluation Context for details on how  the evaluation context is determined for each attribute of the bind element.. Certain elements, such as extension or foreign namespaced elements defined in a host language might be critical to the operation of a particular form. To indicate this, the MustUnderstand module defines a single attribute that can be used on any element. It is a terminating error that must be reported to the user if an element is marked mustUnderstand="true", and the XForms Processor does not have an implementation available for processing the element. There are many different ways a host language might include XForms. One approach uses only well-formed processing, disregarding validation. Another case uses strict validation, for example XHTML 1.0, in which only predefined elements are allowed. Another common approach is to allow unregulated content in a few selected places. A host language that chooses this option can use the Extension module. Optional element extension is a container for application-specific extension elements from any namespace other than the XForms namespace. This specification does not define the processing of this element. Common Attributes: Common For example, RDF metadata could be attached to an individual form control as follows: This chapter defines the XForms Processing Model declaratively by enumerating the various states attained by an XForms Processor and the possible state transitions that exist in each of these states. The chapter enumerates the pre-conditions and post-conditions that must be satisfied in each of these states. XForms Processors may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end results are identical to that described in this chapter. State transitions are in general initiated by sending events to parts of the XForms tree. The XForms Processing Model consists of events in the following categories: Initialization Interaction Notification Error Conditions XForms processing is defined in terms of events, event handlers, and event responses. XForms uses the events system defined in [DOM2 Events][XML Events], with an event capture phase, arrival of the event at its Target, and finally the event bubbling phase. Throughout this chapter, each reference to "form control" as a target element is a shorthand for any of the following elements: input, secret, textarea, output, upload, trigger, range, submit, select, select1, or group. This section defines the various stages of the initialization phase. The processor begins initialization by dispatching an event xforms-model-construct to each XForms Model in the containing document. How the XForms Processor itself is requested to initialize is implementation dependent. Dispatched to each XForms model by the XForms processor. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: All XML Schemas  are  loaded. If an error occurs while attempting to access or process a remote document, processing halts with an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-link-exception Event). If an external source for the initial instance data is given, an XPath data model [7 XPath Expressions in XForms] is constructed from it; otherwise if inline initial instance data is given, that is used instead. If the external initial instance data is not well-formed XML or cannot be retrieved, processing halts with an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-link-exception Event). If neither are given, then default processing of this event ends because  the data model is not constructed in this phase, but during user interface construction (4.2.2 The xforms-model-construct-done Event).  If applicable, P3P initialized. [P3P 1.0] After all XForms Models have been initialized, an xforms-model-construct-done event is dispatched to each model element. Dispatched after the completion of xforms-model-construct processing. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event happens once, no matter how many XForms Models are present in the containing document, and results in the following, for each form control: Processing can proceed in one of two different ways depending on whether an instance in a model exists when the first form control is processed. If the instance referenced on the form control existed when the first form control was processed:  The binding expression is evaluated to ensure that it points to a node that exists. If this is not the case then the form control should behave in the same manner as if it had bound to a model item with the relevant model item property resolved to false. If the instance referenced on the form control did not exist when the first form control for the same instance was processed:  For the first reference to an instance a default instance is created by following the rules described below. A root instanceData element is created. An instance data element node will be created using the binding expression from the user interface control as the name. If the name is not a valid QName, processing halts with an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event).  For the second and subsequent references to an instance which was automatically created the following processing is performed: If a matching instance data node is found, the user interface control will be connected to that element. If a matching instance data node is not found, an instance data node will be created using the binding expression from the user interface control as the name. If the name is not a valid QName, processing halts with an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event).  The above steps comprise the default processing of xforms-model-construct-done. After all form controls have been initialized and all xforms-model-construct-done events have been processed, an xforms-ready event is dispatched to each model element. Dispatched as part of xforms-model-construct-done processing. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. Dispatched by the processor to advise of imminent shutdown of the XForms Processor, which can occur from user action, or from the load XForms Action, or as a result of form submission. Target: model Bubbles: No Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. Dispatched in response to: user request to navigate to the next or previous form control. Target: form control Bubbles: No Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for these events results in the following: Navigation according to the default navigation order. For example, on a keyboard interface, "tab" might generate an xforms-next event, while "shift+tab" might generate an xforms-previous event.  Navigation is determined on a containing document-wide basis. The host language is responsible for defining overall navigation order. The following describes a possible technique based on a navindex attribute, using individual form controls as a navigation unit: The &lt;group&gt;, &lt;repeat&gt;, and &lt;switch&gt; structures also serve as navigation units, but instead of providing a single navigation point, they create a local navigation context for child form controls (and possibly other substructures). The navigation sequence is determined as follows: Form controls that have a navindex specified and assign a positive value to it are navigated first. Outermost form controls are navigated in increasing order of the navindex value. Values need not be sequential nor must they begin with any particular value. Form controls that have identical navindex values are to be navigated in document order. Ancestor form controls (&lt;group&gt;, &lt;repeat&gt;, and &lt;switch&gt;) establish a local navigation sequence. All form controls within a local sequence are navigated, in increasing order of the navindex value, before any outside the local sequence are navigated. Form controls that have identical navindex values are navigated in document order.  Those form controls that do not specify navindex or supply a value of "0" are navigated next. These form controls are navigated in document order. Those form controls that are disabled, hidden, or not relevant are assigned a relative order in the overall sequence but do not participate as navigable controls.  The navigation sequence past the last form control (or before the first) is undefined. XForms Processors may cycle back to the first/last control, remove focus from the form, or other possibilities. Dispatched in response to: set focus to a form control. Target: form control Bubbles: No Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for these events results in the following: Dispatched in response to: a user request for help or hint information. Target: form control Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for these events results in the following: If the form control has help/hint elements supplied, these are used to construct a message that is displayed to the user. Otherwise, user agents may provide default help or hint messages, but are not required to. Dispatched in response to: a request to update all form controls associated with a particular XForms Model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: All UI bindings should be reevaluated as necessary. its current value its validity whether it is required, readonly or relevant. Dispatched in response to: a request to revalidate a particular XForms Model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None the constraint model item property is true The default action for this event results in the following: Dispatched in response to: a request to recalculate all calculations associated with a particular XForms Model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: Dispatched in response to: a request to rebuild the internal data structures that track computational dependencies within a particular XForms Model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: All model item properties are initialized by processing all bind elements in document order. For each bind: For each node in the selected XPath node-set, any child bind elements are recursively processed as described in the three points of this list. Dispatched in response to: a user request to reset the model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: The instance data is reset to the tree structure and values it had immediately after having processed the xforms-ready event. Then, the events xforms-rebuild, xforms-recalculate, xforms-revalidate and xforms-refresh are dispatched to the model element in sequence. See chapter 11  Submit. Dispatched in response to: the "default action request" for a form control, for instance pressing a button or hitting enter. Target: form control Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. Dispatched in response to: a change to an instance data node bound to a form control. Target: form control Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. The change to the instance data associated with this event happens before the event is dispatched. Dispatched in response to: an item in a select, select1, or switch becoming selected or deselected. Target: item or  case Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. Dispatched in response to: a setindex action attempting to set an index outside the range of a repeat.

Dispatched in response to: A event handler invoking an XForms Action insert or delete, successfully adding or deleting a repeat item.. Target: instance Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: Path expression used for insert/delete (xsd:string). The default action for these events results in the following: None; notification event only. Dispatched in response to: an instance data node either changing and being or becoming valid.

Target: form control Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. This event is dispatched whenever the value of an instance data node that was not possible to represent given the constraints specified on a form control has changed such that the value can now be represented by the form control.  Dispatched in response to: the value of an instance data node has changed such that the value can not be represented by the form control.  Target: form control Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. This event is dispatched whenever the value of an instance data node can not be represented given the constraints specified on a form control.  Dispatched in response to: completion of submit processing, including processing any returned document. Target: submission Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. Dispatched as an indication of: a failure of the submit process, as defined at 11  Submit Target: submission Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: The submit method URI that failed (xsd:anyURI) The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. Error indications happen as a result of unusual conditions in the XForms Processor. Some of these are "fatal" errors, which halt processing, and bear the suffix "exception". Others are simply for notification, and bear the suffix "error". For all events in this section, it is permissible for the XForms Processor to perform some kind of default handling, for example logging error messages to a file. Dispatched as an indication of: an illegal binding expression, or a model attribute that fails to point to the ID of a model element, or a bind attribute that fails to point to the ID of a bind element, or a submission attribute that fails to point to the ID of a submission element, or an instance attribute on the submission element that fails to point to an instance element in the same model element as the submission. Target: any element that can contain a binding expression Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: Fatal error. Dispatched as an indication of: a failure in link traversal of a linking attribute. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: The URI that failed to load (xsd:anyURI) The default action for this event results in the following: Fatal error.

Target: the default model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: Fatal error. The previous sections describe processing associated with individual events. This section gives the overall sequence of related events that must occur in several common situations. In the following lists, events that may be fired more than once are prefixed with [n]. When the form control is interactively changed, and has the "incremental="true" setting, the event sequence described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change may be initiated at implementation dependent intervals. When the form control is interactively changed and does not have the "incremental=true" setting, no events are required to be dispatched, and thus no order is defined. When focus changes from the form control and the value has changed, the event sequence is as described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change. No event sequences are defined. When a selection is interactively changed, and the form control has the "incremental="true" setting, the event sequence is described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change, which may be followed immediately by the sequence described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change. When a selection is interactively changed, and the form control does not have the "incremental="true" setting, the event sequence is described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change. When focus changes from the form control and the value has changed, the event sequence is as described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change. Activating the form control causes the event sequence defined at 4.6.8 Sequence: Activating a Trigger. Activating the form control causes the event sequence defined at 4.6.8 Sequence: Activating a Trigger, followed immediately by the event sequence defined at 4.6.9 Sequence: Submission. xforms-deselect xforms-select xforms-recalculate xforms-revalidate [n] xforms-value-changed [n] xforms-valid or xforms-invalid [n] xforms-enabled or xforms-disabled [n] xforms-optional or xforms-required [n] xforms-readonly or xforms-readwrite [n] xforms-out-of-range or xforms-in-range (The order in which these events are dispatched is not defined). Perform further deferred updates as necessary DOMActivate xforms-submit xforms-submit-done or xforms-submit-error This chapter defines the datatypes used in defining an XForms Model. XForms supports all XML Schema datatypes except for xsd:duration, xsd:ENTITY, xsd:ENTITIES, and xsd:NOTATION. Concepts value space, lexical space and constraining facets are as specified in [XML Schema part 2]. Certain XML Schema datatypes have been identified as part of a smaller XForms conformance profile that is being developed separately, and are marked with an asterisk *. XForms includes datatypes derived by restriction and derived by list from these base types. XForms Processors must treat the datatypes listed in the chapter as in-scope without requiring the inclusion of an XML Schema. Built-in primitive types:  xsd:dateTime *  xsd:time *  xsd:date *  xsd:gYearMonth *  xsd:gYear *  xsd:gMonthDay *  xsd:gDay *  xsd:gMonth *  xsd:string *  xsd:boolean *  xsd:base64Binary * xsd:hexBinaryxsd:float xsd:decimal * xsd:double xsd:anyURI * xsd:QName Built-in derived types: xsd:normalizedStringxsd:tokenxsd:languagexsd:Namexsd:NCNamexsd:IDxsd:IDREFxsd:IDREFSxsd:NMTOKENxsd:NMTOKENS xsd:integer *  xsd:nonPositiveInteger *  xsd:negativeInteger *  xsd:long *  xsd:int *  xsd:short *  xsd:byte *  xsd:nonNegativeInteger *  xsd:unsignedLong *  xsd:unsignedInt *  xsd:unsignedShort *  xsd:unsignedByte *  xsd:positiveInteger *  The Schema for XForms derives the following types to facilitate defining model in XForms. This datatype serves as a base for the xforms:listItems datatype. The value space for listItem permits one or more characters valid for xsd:string, except white space characters.  XForms includes form controls that produce simpleType list content. This is facilitated by defining a derived-by-list datatype. The value space for listItems is defined by list-derivation from listItem. In most cases, it is better to use markup to distinguish items in a list. See 9.3.3 The itemset Element. XForms includes a totally ordered duration datatype that can represent a duration of days, hours, minutes, and fractional seconds. The value space for this datatype is the set of fractional second values. This datatype is derived from xsd:duration. XForms includes a totally ordered duration datatype that can represent a duration of a whole number of months and years. The value space for this datatype is the set of integer month values. This datatype is derived from xsd:duration. This chapter defines infoset contributions that can be bound to instance data nodes with element bind (see 3.3.4 The bind Element). The combination of these contributions to an instance data node is called a model item. Taken together, these contributions are called model item properties, and are defined in the following section. In contrast, the term Schema constraint refers only to XML Schema constraints from the facets of a given datatype. Model item properties can be distinguished along various axes. Computed expressions vs. fixed properties: Fixed properties are static values that the XForms Processor evaluates only once. Such properties consist of literals, and are not subject to XPath evaluation. Computed expressions are XPath expressions that provide a value to the XForms Processor. Such values are recalculated at certain times as specified by the XForms Processing Model (see 4 Processing Model). These expressions encode dynamic properties, often constraints, such as the dependency among various data items. Computed expressions are not restricted to examining the value of the instance data node to which they apply. XPath expressions provide the means to traverse the instance data; more complex computations may be encoded as call-outs to external scripts. Inheritance rules: Some model item properties define inheritance rules, in which case the XForms Processor needs to keep track of two separate values: 1) the local value, which is applied from an attribute of element bind, and 2) the inherited value, which is determined by combining the evaluated local value with the evaluated values from ancestor nodes in the instance data. The sample recalculation algorithm defined in D Recalculation Sequence Algorithm is defined to operate only on the local values of a model item property. It assumes that an implementation propagates the combined values to a node's descendants. Assigning local values: Local values are assigned by processing all bind elements in an XForms Model in document order. It is an error to attempt to set a model item property twice on the same node. The details of this process are given at 4.2.1 The xforms-model-construct Event. The following sections list the model item properties available as part of all model items. For each, the following information is provided: DescriptionComputed Expression (yes or no)Legal ValuesDefault ValueInheritance Rules Computed Expression: No. Default Value: xsd:string. Inheritance Rules: does not inherit. The first bind expresses the default datatype of xsd:string. Description: describes whether the value is restricted from changing.  Computed Expression: Yes.  Legal Values: Any expression that is convertible to XPath boolean with boolean().  Default Value: false(), unless a calculate property is specified, then true().  Inheritance Rules: If any ancestor node evaluates to true, this value is treated as true. Otherwise, the local value is used. This is the equivalent of taking the logical OR of the evaluated readonly property on the local and every ancestor node. When evaluating to true, this model item property indicates that the XForms Processor should not allow any changes to the bound instance data node.  In addition to restricting value changes, the readonly model item property provides a hint to the XForms user interface. Form controls bound to instance data with the readonly model item property should indicate that entering or changing the value is not allowed. This specification does not define any effect on visibility, focus, or navigation order. Here, we have associated a readonly property with an element. Description: describes whether a value is required before the instance data is submitted. Computed Expression: Yes. Legal Values: Any expression that is convertible to XPath boolean with boolean().  Default Value: false().  Inheritance Rules: does not inherit. A form may require certain values, and this requirement may be dynamic. When evaluating to true, this model item property indicates that a non-empty instance data node is required before a submission of instance data can occur. Non-empty is defined as:  If the bound instance data node is an element, the element must not have the xsi:nil attribute set to true.  The value of the bound instance data node must be convertible to an XPath string with a length greater than zero.  Except as noted below, the required model item property does not provide a hint to the XForms user interface regarding visibility, focus, or navigation order. XForms authors are strongly encouraged to make sure that form controls that accept required data are visible. An XForms Processor may provide an indication that a form control is required, and may provide immediate feedback, including limiting navigation. Chapter 4 Processing Model contains details on how the XForms Processor enforces required values. Here, we have associated a required property with element my:last-name to indicate that a value must be supplied. XML Schema has a similarly named concept with use="required|optional|prohibited". This is different than the XForms Model item property, in two ways: 1) use applies only to attributes, while XForms required applies to any node. 2) use is concerned with whether the entire attribute must be specified (without regard to value), while required determines whether a value is required of the node before submission.  Description: indicates whether the model item is currently relevant. Instance data nodes with this property evaluating to false are not serialized for submission. Computed Expression: Yes. Legal Values: Any expression that is convertible to XPath boolean with boolean(). Default Value: true(). Inheritance Rules: If any ancestor node evaluates to XPath false, this value is treated as false. Otherwise, the local value is used. This is the equivalent of taking the logical AND of the evaluated relevant property on the local and every ancestor node. Many forms have data entry sections that depend on other conditions. For example, a form might ask whether the respondent owns a car. It is only appropriate to ask for further information about their car if they have indicated that they own one. The relevant model item property provides information to the XForms user interface regarding visibility, focus, and navigation order. In general, when true, associated form controls should be made visible. When false, associated form controls (and any children) and group and switch elements (including content) must be made unavailable, removed from the navigation order, and not allowed focus. Typically, non-relevant content is not presented, or it may be styled as disabled. A form control, group or switch must express a single node binding in order to be associated with an instance node. Here, we have associated a relevant property with element my:discount to indicate a discount is relevant when the order amount is greater than 1000. Description: supplies an expression used to calculate  a string value for  the associated instance data node. Computed Expression: Yes. Legal Values: Any XPath expression. Default Value: none. Inheritance Rules: does not inherit. An XForms Model may include model items whose string values  are computed from other values. For example, the sum over line items for quantity times unit price, or the amount of tax to be paid on an order.  Such computed values can be expressed with calculate properties, whose XPath expressions are evaluated and converted to strings with the XPath string() function. Chapter 4 Processing Model contains details of when and how the calculation is performed. Here, we have associated a relevant property with element my:discount to indicate a discount of 10% is relevant when the order amount is greater than 1000. Description: specifies a predicate that needs to be satisfied for the associated instance data node to be considered valid. Computed Expression: Yes. Legal Values: Any expression that is convertible to XPath boolean with boolean(). Default Value: true(). Inheritance Rules: does not inherit.  When evaluating to XPath false, the associated model item is not valid; the converse is not necessarily true. Chapter 4 Processing Model contains details of when and how the constraint is calculated as well as when validation is performed.  Here, a constraint property associated with element my:to indicates that its value must be greater than that of element my:from. Specifying minimum and maximum occurrences for nodes in the instance data can be achieved by using the count() function within a constraint property. Description: Attaches a P3P data element to an instance data node, indicating the specific kind of data collected there. Computed Expression: No. Legal Values: xsd:string. Default Value: none Inheritance Rules: does not inherit. This model item property holds a description of the kind of data collected by the associated instance data node, based on the P3P datatype system [P3P 1.0]. This information may be used to enhance the form-fill experience, for example by supplying previously-known data.  Here, we have attached both XML Schema and P3P type information to element first-name via element bind. Chapter 5 Datatypes described how XForms uses the XML Schema datatype system to constrain the value space of data values collected by an XForms Model. Such datatype constraints can be provided via an XML Schema. Alternatively, this section lists various mechanisms for attaching type constraints to instance data. Attributes xsi:schemaLocation and xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation are ignored for purposes for locating a Schema. The XForms Processing Model applies XML Schema facets as part of the validation process. At the simplest level, it is necessary to associate a set of facets (through an XML Schema datatype) with a model item. This has the effect of restricting the allowable values of the associated instance data node to valid representations of the lexical space of the datatype.  The set of facets associated with a model item must be determined by the following list, as if it were processed in the given order. When multiple datatype restrictions apply to the same model item, the combination of all given restrictions must apply. Note that it is possible to produce a combination of restrictions that is impossible to satisfy; authors are encouraged to avoid this practice.  An XML Schema associated with the instance data. An XML Schema xsi:type attribute in the instance data. An XForms type constraint associated with the instance data node using XForms binding. If no type constraint is provided, the instance data node defaults to type="xsd:string" (default to string rule). The following declares a datatype based on xsd:string with an additional constraining facet. This new datatype would then be associated with one or more model items through one of the methods outlined here. This defines element first-name to be of type my:nonEmptyString.   Here, we have attached type information to element first-name via element bind. Thus the XForms author can extend external schemas without having the ability to change them.  XForms uses XPath to address instance data nodes in binding expressions, to express constraints, and to specify calculations. XPath expressions that are not syntactically valid, including attempted calls to undefined functions, result in an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-compute-exception Event), except for binding expressions, which produce a different exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). XPath datatypes are used only in binding expressions and computed expressions. XForms uses XPath datatypes boolean, string, number, and node-set. A future version of XForms is expected to use XPath 2.0, which includes support for XML Schema datatypes.  For this version of the XForms specification, the feature string for the [DOM2 Core] DOMImplementation interface hasFeature method call is "org.w3c.xforms.dom" and the version string is "1.0".   For each model element, the XForms Processor maintains the state in an internal structure called instance data that conforms to the XPath Data Model [XPath 1.0]. XForms Processors that implement DOM must provide DOM access to this instance data via the interface defined below.  Instance data always has a single root element, and thus corresponds to a DOM Document.  The IDL for this interface follows: If the instance-id parameter is the empty string, then the document element of the default instance is returned.  Otherwise,  this method returns a DOM Document that corresponds to the instance data associated with the instance element containing an ID matching the instance-id parameter. If there is no matching instance data, a DOMException is thrown.  This method signals the XForms Processor to rebuild any internal data structures used to track computational dependencies within this XForms Model. This method takes no parameters and raises no exceptions.  This method signals the XForms Processor to perform a full recalculation of this XForms Model. This method takes no parameters and raises no exceptions.  This method signals the XForms Processor to perform a full revalidation of this XForms Model. This method takes no parameters and raises no exceptions.  This method signals the XForms Processor to perform a full refresh of form controls bound to instance nodes within this XForms Model. This method takes no parameters and raises no exceptions.  Within XForms, the default model is the first model in document order.  The default instance of any model is the first child instance in document order within that model..  XPath expressions appearing in various XForms attributes are used to reference  instance data .  Every XPath expression requires an evaluation context consisting of a node, position, size, variable bindings, function set, and namespace context.  For all evaluation contexts in XForms, No variable bindings are in place.   The available function library is defined below in 7.6 The XForms Function Library.   Any namespace declarations in scope for the attribute that defines the expression are applied to the expression.  The context node, position and size are determined according to rules described below. A binding element is any element that is explicitly allowed to have a binding expression attribute, and a bound element is any element that explicitly declares a binding expression attribute. A binding expression attribute contains an XPath expression that references zero or more nodes of instance data.  Every XPath expression requires an evaluation context. The in-scope evaluation context of a binding element provides an evaluation context for the binding expression attribute.  The following rules are used in determining the node, position and size of the in-scope evaluation context:  A binding element is "outermost" if the element has no ancestor binding elements. If an outermost binding element is contained by a model, then the context node for the outermost binding element is the top-level document element node of the default instance of the containing model element. Otherwise, the context node for outermost binding elements is the top-level document element node of the default instance in the default model.  For outermost binding elements, the context size and position are 1.  The context node, position and size for non-outermost binding elements is determined using  the binding expression attribute or in-scope evaluation context  of the  nearest ancestor binding element.  This is also referred to as "scoped resolution". For a non-outermost binding element: If the nearest ancestor binding element is not a bound element, then the in-scope evaluation context of the non-outermost binding element is equivalent to the in-scope evaluation context of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Single-Node binding, then the in-scope evaluation context of the non-outermost binding element has a context size and position of 1 and the context node is the one resulting from the Single-Node binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Node Set binding, then the XForms processor dynamically generates an occurrence of the non-outermost binding element for each of the nodes in the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element.  The dynamic in-scope evaluation context for each generated occurrence of the non-outermost binding element has a context size equal to the size of the nodeset identified by the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element, the context node is the node for which the occurrence of the non-outermost binding element was generated, and the position is equal to the position of the generator node in the nodeset identified by the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Node Set binding, then the non-outermost binding element has its own in-scope evaluation context separately from those of its dynamically generated occurences described above.  The in-scope evaluation context has a context position of 1, and the context node and size are set by the first node and the size of the nodeset identified by the Node Set binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. Once the context node of the in-scope evaluation context has been determined according to the rules above, if the binding element expresses a model attribute that refers to a model other than the one containing the context node, then the context node of the in-scope evaluation context is changed to be the top-level document element node of the default instance of the referenced model, and the context position and size are changed to 1. The rules above for determining the in-scope evaluation context are applicable to XForms elements that can contain a binding expression attribute even if they cannot contain a Single Node Binding or Node Set Binding.  The elements bind and submission are examples. The in-scope evaluation context of an element that is not a binding element is the same as if the element were a binding element. For example, the in-scope evaluation context for the setindex action element is required to provide the context for evaluating the index attribute, so it is determined as if the element could contain a binding expression attribute. XPath expressions also appear in model item property attributes of the bind element to define computed expressions.  If the bind element does not express a Node Set binding, then the in-scope evaluation context for model item property attributes of the bind is equal to the in-scope evaluation context for the bind.  Otherwise, the bind has a Node Set binding, and computed expressions for each model item property attribute are generated for each node.  For each computed expression generated, the evaluation context node, position and size are determined by the same method as dynamic in-scope evaluation context rule above, except the computed expression is used in lieu of a binding expression attribute such that the bind element is the nearest ancestor binding element. XPath expressions also appear in the special attributes of several other XForms elements, such as the value attribute on setvalue and output, the at attribute of insert and delete, or the index attribute of setindex.  Generally, if the containing element does not express a Single Node Binding or Node Set Binding, then the special attribute is evaluated using the in-scope evaluation context.  Special attributes may be evaluated using the in-scope evaluation context even if the containing element expresses a Single Node Binding or Node Set Binding.  However, for some special attributes, the evaluation context node, position and size are based on the result of the Single Node Binding or Node set Binding.  Each special attribute that contains an XPath expression describes how its evaluation context node, position and size are determined.  In the following example, the group has a binding expression of level2/level3. According to the rules above, this outermost element node would have a context node of /level1, which is the  document element node of the instance data. The select1 form control then inherits a context node from the parent group.  This section describes how the in-scope evaluation context of an element is determined, not whether the in-scope evaluation will be used.  The Single-Node Binding or Node Set Binding of a non-outermost binding element is not evaluated if the in-scope evaluation context does not contain a context node.  This can occur if the Single-Node Binding or Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor bound element produces an empty nodeset.  Also, if the Single-Node Binding or Node Set Binding of an element is expressed with the bind attribute, then the resulting node or nodeset is obtained from the referenced bind element.  The nodeset attribute of a bind element is evaluated using the in-scope evaluation of the bind element, not the in-scope evaluation context of an element that references it with a bind attribute. A binding expression is an XPath  expression used in binding a model item property to one or more instance nodes, or to bind a form control to instance data, or to specify the node or node set for operation by an action. By default, all binding expressions refer to the first instance within the context model. This behavior can be changed with the instance() function.  An XPath predicate (in square brackets) is a possibly implicit boolean test. A dynamic dependency exists on any predicate unless all terms in the test are "fixed", where fixed means either a constant, or a value that will not change between operations explicitly defined as rebuilding computational dependencies.  For purposes of determining dynamic dependencies, the following subexpressions are considered fixed: position(), last(), count(), and property(). This is because the specification mandates a dependency rebuild after any event that could change the values returned by these functions.  Another dynamic dependency is any use of the id() function, unless both the parameter to the function and the matching attribute of type xsd:ID are fixed. In the same way, the instance() function is dynamic unless the parameter to the function is fixed.  XPath variables that change in value from one recalculate to the next would also create dynamic dependencies (though XForms 1.0 defines an empty variable context for all XPath expressions).  Authors that define extension functions are encouraged to follow these rules.   A model binding expression is a kind of binding expression that can be used to declare model item properties, and is used in attributes of the bind element. Dynamic dependencies in model binding expressions will generally require manual rebuilding of dependencies. Binding references can be used to bind form controls to the underlying instance data as described here. Different attribute names, ref and nodeset distinguish between a single node and a node-set respectively. See 3.2.3 Single-Node Binding Attributes and 3.2.4 Node-Set Binding Attributes.  Dynamic dependences are allowed in UI binding expressions based on the conformance profile.   The XForms binding mechanism allows other XML vocabularies to bind user interface controls to an XForms Model using any of the techniques shown here. As an example, XForms binding attribute bind might be used within XHTML 1.x user interface controls as shown below. See 3.2.3 Single-Node Binding Attributes and 3.2.4 Node-Set Binding Attributes.  Consider the following document with the one-and-only XForms model:  The following examples show three ways of binding user interface control xforms:input to instance element firstName declared in the model shown above.   The XForms Function Library includes the entire [XPath 1.0] Core Function Library, including operations on node-sets, strings, numbers, and booleans.   The following sections define additional required functions for use within XForms : 7.7 Boolean Functions, 7.8 Number Functions, 7.9 String Functions, 7.10 Date and Time Functions and 7.11 Node-set Functions.  The function library provided by an XForms processor may also contain other extension functions as described in 7.12 Extension Functions. boolean boolean-from-string(string)  Function boolean-from-string returns true if the required parameter string is "true" or "1", or false if parameter string is "false", or "0". This is useful when referencing a Schema xsd:boolean datatype in an XPath expression. If the parameter string matches none of the above strings, according to a case-insensitive comparison, the return value is false. string if(boolean, string, string) Function if evaluates the first parameter as boolean, returning the second parameter when true, otherwise the third parameter.  number avg(node-set)  Function avg returns the arithmetic average of the result of converting the string-values of each node in the argument node-set to a number. The sum is computed with sum(), and divided with div by the value computed with count(). If the parameter is an empty node-set, or if any of the nodes evaluate to NaN, the return value is NaN.  number min(node-set)  Function min returns the minimum value of the result of converting the string-values of each node in argument node-set to a number. "Minimum" is determined with the &lt; operator. If the parameter is an empty node-set, or if any of the nodes evaluate to NaN, the return value is NaN.  number max(node-set)  Function max returns the maximum value of the result of converting the string-values of each node in argument node-set to a number. "Maximum" is determined with the &lt; operator. If the parameter is an empty node-set, or if any of the nodes evaluate to NaN, the return value is NaN.  number count-non-empty(node-set)  Function count-non-empty returns the number of non-empty nodes in argument node-set. A node is considered non-empty if it is convertible into a string with a greater-than zero length.  number index(string)  Function index takes a string argument that is the IDREF of a repeat and returns the current 1-based position of the repeat index for the identified repeat&mdash;see 9.3.1 The repeat Element for details on repeat and its associated repeat index. if the specified argument does not identify a repeat, the function returns NaN. string property(string)  Function property returns the XForms property named by the string parameter.   The following properties are available for reading (but not modification).  version is defined as the string "1.0" for XForms 1.0. conformance-level strings are defined in 12 Conformance.  The following XML Schema datatypes do not have specific functions for manipulation within XForms expressions: xsd:time, xsd:gYearMonth, xsd:gYear, xsd:gMonthDay, xsd:gDay, xsd:gMonth. Extension functions (7.12 Extension Functions) may be used to perform needed operations on these datatypes.  string now()  The now function returns the current system date and time as a string value in the canonical XML Schema xsd:dateTime format. If time zone information is available, it is included (normalized to UTC). If no time zone information is available, an implementation default is used.  Attaching a calculation of "now()" to an instance data node would not result in a stream of continuous recalculations of the XForms Model.  number days-from-date(string) This function returns a whole number of days, according to the following rules:  If the string parameter represents a legal lexical xsd:date or xsd:dateTime, the return value is equal to the number of days difference between the specified date or dateTime (normalized to UTC) and 1970-01-01. Hour, minute, and second components are ignored after normalization. Any other input parameter causes a return value of NaN.  Examples: days-from-date("2002-01-01") returns 11688days-from-date("1969-12-31") returns -1 number seconds-from-dateTime(string) This function returns a possibly fractional number of seconds, according to the following rules:  If the string parameter represents a legal lexical xsd:dateTime, the return value is equal to the number of seconds difference between the specified dateTime (normalized to UTC) and 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. If no time zone is specified, UTC is used. Any other input string parameter causes a return value of NaN.  number seconds(string) This function returns a possibly fractional number of seconds, according to the following rules:  If the string parameter represents a legal lexical xsd:duration, the return value is equal to the number specified in the seconds component plus 60 * the number specified in the minutes component, plus 60 * 60 * the number specified in the hours component, plus 60 * 60 * 24 * the number specified in the days component. The sign of the result will match the sign of the duration. Year and month components, if present, are ignored. Any other input parameter causes a return value of NaN.  Examples:  seconds("P1Y2M") returns 0seconds("P3DT10H30M1.5S") returns 297001.5 seconds("3") returns NaN  Even though this function is defined based on a lexical xsd:duration, it is intended for use only with derived-from-xsd:duration datatypes, specifically xforms:dayTimeDuration.  number months(string) This function returns a whole number of months, according to the following rules:  If the string parameter represents a legal lexical xsd:duration, the return value is equal to the number specified in the months component plus 12 * the number specified in the years component. The sign of the result will match the sign of the duration. Day, hour, minute, and second components, if present, are ignored. Any other input parameter causes a return value of NaN.  Examples:  months("P1Y2M") returns 14months("-P19M") returns -19 Even though this function is defined based on a lexical xsd:duration, it is intended for use only with derived-from-xsd:duration datatypes, specifically xforms:yearMonthDuration.  node-set instance(string?) An XForms Model can contain more than  one instance. This function allows access to instance data, within the same XForms Model, but outside the instance data containing the context node.  Otherwise,  the argument is converted to a string as if by a call to the string function. This string is treated as an IDREF, which is matched against instance elements in the containing document. If a match is located, and the matching instance data is associated with the same XForms Model as the current context node, this function returns a node-set containing just the root element node (also called the document element node) of the referenced instance data. In all other cases, an empty node-set is returned.  Example: For instance data corresponding to this XML:  The following expression selects the firstName node. Note that the instance function returns an element node, effectively replacing the leftmost location step from the path:  XForms documents may use additional XPath extension functions beyond those described here. A number of useful community extensions are defined at [EXSLT]. The names of any such extension functions must be declared in attribute functions on element model. Such declarations are used by the XForms Processor to check against available extension functions. XForms Processors perform this check at the time the document is loaded, and stop processing by signaling an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-compute-exception Event) if the XForms document declares an extension function for which the processor does not have an implementation.   Explicitly declaring extension functions enables XForms Processors to detect the use of unimplemented extension functions at document load-time, rather than throwing a fatal error during user interaction. Failure by authors to declare extension functions will result in an XForms Processor potentially halting processing during user interaction with a fatal error.  Form controls are declared using markup elements, and their behavior refined via markup attributes.  See also: 9.3.3 The itemset Element. Unless bound to form controls, instance data nodes are not presented to the user; consequently, there is no need for a form control corresponding to HTML input type="hidden".  The following attributes are common to many user-interface related XForms elements, here called the UI Common attribute group. Optional attribute to define an appearance hint. if absent, the user agent may freely choose any suitable rendering. A host language is expected to add attributes such as xml:lang as well as an attribute, named class, that holds a list of strings that can be matched by CSS class selectors. Further, a host language must provide a way to indicate overall navigation order among form controls and other elements included in the host language, as well as keyboard or direct access navigation to specific elements. One such proposal is to uses a pair of attributes named navindex and accesskey, defined as follows: Optional attribute is a non-negative integer in the range of 0-32767 used to define the navigation sequence. This gives the author control over the sequence in which form controls are traversed. The default navigation order is specified in the chapter 4 Processing Model. Optional attribute defines a shortcut for moving the input focus directly to a particular form control. The value of this is a single character which when pressed together with a platform specific modifier key (e.g., the alt key) results in the focus being set to this form control. The user agent must provide a means of identifying the accesskeys that can be used in a presentation. This may be accomplished in different ways by different implementations, for example through direct interaction with the application or via the user's guide. The accesskey requested by the author might not be made available by the player (for example it may not exist on the device used, or it may be used by the player itself). Therefore the user agent should make the specified key available, but may map the accesskey to a different interaction behavior. Additionally, this module defines the following content sets: As shown above, the XML Events module adds the Actions content set into the UI Common content set. A host language should add inline markup to the Inline content set. When the XForms Extension module is present, it too should be included in the UI Common content set. XForms user interface controls are bound to the underlying instance data using binding attributes as defined in the chapter 6 Model Item Properties. Form controls enable accessibility by taking a uniform approach to such features as labels, help text, navigation, and keyboard shortcuts. Internationalization issues are addressed by following the same design principles as in XHTML. All form controls are suitable for styling as aural or visual media. Form controls encapsulate high-level semantics without sacrificing the ability to deliver real implementations. For instance, the form control select enables the user to select items from a set. These form controls distinguish the functional aspects of the underlying control from the presentational and behavioral aspects. This separation enables the expression of the intent underlying a particular form control&mdash;see [AUI97] for a definition of such high-level user interaction primitives.  Form controls when rendered display the underlying data values to which they are bound. While the data presented to the user through a form control must directly correspond to the bound instance data, the display representation is not required to match the lexical value. For example, user agents should apply appropriate conventions to the display of dates, times, durations and numeric values including separator characters. All form controls must meet the following implementation requirements: If a form control violates its data binding restriction, an xforms-binding-exception must occur. Form controls that write simpleContent to instance data must do so exactly as defined by the XForms Action 10.1.9 The setvalue Element All form controls that read simpleContent instance data must do so as follows: Attribute nodes: returns the string-value of the node. Text nodes: returns the string-value of the node. Namespace, processing instruction, comment, and the XPath root node: behavior is undefined. Form controls must distinguish rendering between valid and invalid states. Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. Form controls must indicate when the bound instance data contains a value the form control is not capable of rendering. Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. Form controls must provide a default explanation for the above when no user-specified explanation is available. Form controls are considered to be non-relevant if any of the following apply: the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to empty nodeset, the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to a non-relevant instance node, the form control is contained by a non-relevant switch or group (which includes a non-relevant repeat item), or the form control is contained by a non-selected case element of a switch.  Sections in this chapter define the various form controls by specifying the following: DescriptionCommon AttributesSpecial AttributesExamplesData Binding RestrictionsImplementation Requirements Description: This form control enables free-form data entry. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. when true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Example:  In the above, the class attribute can be used by a style sheet to specify the display size of the form control. Note that the constraints on how much text can be input are obtained from the underlying XForms Model definition and not from these display properties. A graphical browser might render the above example as follows:    Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent (except xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary or any datatype derived from these). Implementation Requirements: Must allow entry of a lexical value for the bound datatype. Implementations should provide a convenient means for entry of datatypes and take into account localization and internationalization issues such as representation of numbers. For example, an input bound to an instance data node of type xsd:date might provide a calendar control to enter dates; similarly, an input control bound to of type boolean might be rendered as a checkbox. A graphical browser might render the above example as follows:    The user can type a date into the text edit box, or press the button to open a calendar:    Description: This form control is used to provide the user with the ability to supply information to the system in a manner that makes it difficult for someone, other than the user, who may be observing the process to discern the value that is being supplied. A common use is for password entry. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. when true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Example: A graphical browser might render this form control as follows:   Data Binding Restrictions: Identical to input. Implementation Requirements: Implementations, including accessibility aids, must obscure the value being entered into this form control. One possible approach would be to render a "*" or similar character instead of the actual characters entered. Note that this provides only a casual level of security; truly sensitive information will require additional security measures outside the scope of XForms. Description: This form control enables free-form data entry and is intended for use in entering multiline content, e.g., the body of an email message. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. when true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Example:  In the above, the class attribute can be used by a style sheet to specify the display size of the form control. Note that the constraints on how much text can be input are obtained from the underlying XForms Model definition and not from these display properties. A graphical browser might render the above example as follows:    Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to xsd:string or any derived simpleContent. Implementation Requirements: Must allow entry of a lexical value for the bound datatype, including multiple lines of text.  Description: This form control renders a value from the instance data, but provides no means for entering or changing data. It is used to display values from the instance, and is treated as display:inline for purposes of layout. Element output can be used to display the value at a particular location in the instance by using a binding expression; it can also be used to display the result of evaluating an XPath expression by specifying the XPath expression to be evaluated via attribute value instead of ref. Note that attributes ref and value on element output are mutually exclusive. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (optional) Special Attributes: This form control does not use the UI Common attribute group, but nevertheless still contains an optional appearance attribute, as defined above. Optional. An XPath expression to be evaluated. The string result of the evaluation is rendered by the form control. If binding attributes are present to select a node, this attribute has no effect. The evaluation context is the same as would be applied to the evaluation of the single node binding. This XPath expression is re-evaluated whenever there is a change in any node to which the expression refers. Example: A graphical browser might render an output form control as follows:    Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent. Implementation Requirements: Must allow display of a lexical value for the bound datatype. Implementations should provide a convenient means for display of datatypes and take into account localization and internationalization issues such as representation of numbers. Description: This form control enables the common feature found on Web sites to upload a file from the local file system, as well as accepting input from various devices including microphones, pens, and digital cameras. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Optional. Space-separated list of suggested media types, used by the XForms Processor to determine the possible sources of data to upload.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is false. Example: A graphical browser might render this form control as follows:    Implementation Requirements: On activation, if child element filename is present and a filename is available, upload places the filename of the data to upload in the instance at the node indicated by the binding attributes on child element filename. On activation, if child element mediatype is present and a mediatype is available, upload places the mediatype of the data to upload in the instance at the node indicated by the binding attributes on child element mediatype.  Data Binding Restrictions: This form control can only be bound to datatypes xsd:anyURI, xsd:base64Binary or xsd:hexBinary, or types derived by restriction from these. Implementation Requirements: For base64Binary or hexBinary data binding: When bound to an instance data node of type xsd:base64binary, xsd:hexBinary, or a type derived by restriction thereof, on activation upload places the binary content in the content of the node with the indicated encoding. Implementation Requirements: For anyURI data binding: When bound to an instance data node of type xsd:anyURI (or a type derived by restriction thereof), on activation upload places a URI in the content of the node. For security reasons, the XForms Processor must not dereference the URI bound to this form control without explicit user permission. Implementors note that upload must associate the binary content, mediatype, and filename with that URI for 11.4 Serialization as multipart/related and 11.5 Serialization as multipart/form-data serialization.  Implementations with a file system should support file upload&mdash;selecting a specific file. The types of files presented by default should reflect the mediatype specified by attribute mediatype, for example defaulting to only audio file types in the file dialog when the mediatype is "audio/*".  Implementation Requirements: For all data bindings: Implementations with specific pen/digitizer hardware should (and implementations with other pointing devices may) support scribble&mdash;allowing in-place creation of pen-based data.  Implementations with specific audio recording capabilities should support record audio&mdash;in-place recording of an audio clip.  Implementations with a digital camera, scanner interface or screen capture should support acquire image&mdash;in-place upload of images from an attached device.  Implementations with video recording capability should provide a record video option.  Implementations with 3d capabilities should provide a 3d interface option. Implementations may provide proprietary implementations (for example, a mediatype of text/rtf could invoke an edit window with a proprietary word processing application) Implementations are encouraged to support other input devices not mentioned here. Implementations which cannot support upload for the given mediatype must make this apparent to the user. See the child elements filename 8.3.1 The filename Element and mediatype 8.3.2 The mediatype Element.  Description: This form control allows selection from a sequential range of values. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Optional hint for the lexical starting bound for the range&mdash;a legal value for the underlying data. If provided, this value is used to further refine the constraints specified by the underlying model. Optional hint for the ending bound for the range&mdash;a legal value for the underlying data. If provided, this value is used to further refine the constraints specified by the underlying model. Optional value to use for incrementing or decrementing the value. Must be of a type capable of expressing the difference between two legal values of the underlying data. When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is false. Example: A graphical browser might render this as follows:    Data Binding Restrictions: Binds only the following list of datatypes, or datatypes derived by restriction from those in the list: xsd:duration, xsd:date, xsd:time, xsd:dateTime, xsd:gYearMonth, xsd:gYear, xsd:gMonthDay, xsd:gDay, xsd:gMonth, xsd:float, xsd:decimal, xsd:double. Implementation Requirements: Must allow input of a value corresponding to the bound datatype. Implementations should inform the user of the upper and lower bounds, as well as the step size, if any. If the instance data value is outside the upper or lower bounds, this form control must indicate an out-of-range condition. In graphical environments, this form control may be rendered as a "slider" or "rotary control". Notice that the attributes of this element encapsulate sufficient metadata that in conjunction with the type information available from the XForms Model proves sufficient to produce meaningful prompts when using modalities such as speech, e.g., when using an accessibility aid. Thus, in the example below, an aural user agent might speak a prompt of the form Please pick a date in the range January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001. In the event of overlapping restrictions between the underlying datatype and the start and end hints, the most restrictive range should be used. Example: Description: This form control is similar to the HTML element button and allows for user-triggered actions. This form control may also be used to construct other custom form controls. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding (optional) Example: Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any node. This form control does not directly interact with form data, but is affected by model item properties of the bound node, thus binding attributes are not required. Implementation Requirements: The user agent must provide a means to generate an DOMActivate event on the form control. Graphical implementations might render this form control as a push-button with the label on the button face. Style sheets can be used to style this form control as an image, hyperlink, or other presentation. Description: This form control initiates submission of all or part of the instance data to which it is bound. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding (optional) Special Attributes: Required reference to element submission. Example: Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any node. This form control does not directly interact with form data, but is affected by model item properties of the bound node, thus binding attributes are not required. Description: This form control allows the user to make multiple selections from a set of choices. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Optional attribute determining whether free entry is allowed in the list. Default is "closed". When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is true. Example: In the above example, more than one flavor can be selected. A graphical browser might render form control select as any of the following: Typically, a style sheet would be used to determine the exact appearance of form controls, though a means is provided to suggest an appearance through attribute appearance. The value of the attribute consists of one of the following values:  "full": all choices should be rendered at all times."compact": a fixed number of choices should be rendered, with scrolling facilities as needed"minimal": a minimum number of choices should be rendered, with a facility to temporarily render additional choices Data Binding Restrictions: any simpleContent capable of holding a sequence. The restriction to binding simpleContent exists when the choices are authored as part of the user interface control as shown in this section. Element itemset for creating dynamic selections described in 9.3.3 The itemset Element allows the available choices to be obtained from an XForms Model, and when using that construct, the data binding restriction to simpleContent is relaxed. A limitation of the XML Schema list datatypes is that white space characters in the storage values (the value element) are always interpreted as separators between individual data values. Therefore, authors should avoid using white space characters within storage values with list simpleContent. When selected, this item would introduce not one but four additional selection values: "America", "of", "States", and "United". Implementation Requirements: The label for each choice must be presented, allowing at any number of selections, possibly none. This form control stores the values corresponding to the selected choices as a space separated list in the location addressed by attribute ref. The values to be stored are either directly specified as the contents of element value, or specified indirectly through binding attributes on element value.  Note that the datatype bound to this form control may include a non-enumerated value space, e.g., xsd:string, or a union of a enumeration and a non-enumerated datatype (called an open enumeration). In this case, control select may have attribute selection="open". The form control should then allow free data entry, as described in 8.1.2 The input Element. The form control may permit multiple values to be entered through free entry.  For closed selections: If the initial instance value matches the storage value of one or more of the given items, those items are selected. If there is no match, no items are initially selected. If any selected values do not have a choice with a matching storage value, the form control must indicate an out-of-range condition. For open selections: If the initial instance values match the storage value specified by one or more of the items, the all such matching items are selected. If the initial instance values do not match the storage value specified by one or more of the items, all such non-matching items are included as selected values, as if entered through free entry. Free entry text is handled the same as form control input 8.1.2 The input Element, possibly in multiplicity. When using dynamic selections with complexTypes, open selection has no effect. Implementation Hints: An accessibility aid might allow the user to browse through the available choices and leverage the grouping of choices in the markup to provide enhanced navigation through long lists of choices. Description: This form control allows the user to make a single selection from multiple choices. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Optional attribute determining whether free entry is allowed in the list. Default is "closed". When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is true. Example:  In the above example, selecting one of the choices will result in the associated value given by element value on the selected item being set in the underlying instance data at the location icecream/flavor.  A graphical browser might render this form control as any of the following: Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent. The restriction to binding simpleContent exists when the choices are authored as part of the user interface control as shown in this section. Element itemset for creating dynamic selections described in 9.3.3 The itemset Element allows the available choices to be obtained from an XForms Model, and when using that construct, the data binding restriction to simpleContent is relaxed. Implementation Requirements: The label for each choice must be presented, allowing at all times exactly one selection. This form control stores the value corresponding to the selected choice in the location addressed by attribute ref. The value to be stored is either directly specified as the contents of element value, or specified indirectly through binding attributes on element value. Note that the datatype bound to this form control may include a non-enumerated value space, e.g., xsd:string, or a union of a enumeration and a non-enumerated datatype (called an open enumeration). In this case, control select1 may have attribute selection="open". The form control should then allow free data entry, as described in 8.1.2 The input Element.   For closed selections: If the initial instance value matches the storage value of one of the given items, that item is selected. If there is no match, the form control must indicate an out-of-range condition..  For open selections: If the initial instance value matches the storage value specified by one of the items, the first such matching item is selected. Otherwise, the selected value is the initial lexical value. Free entry text is handled the same as form control input 8.1.2 The input Element.  User interfaces may choose to render this form control as a pulldown list or group of radio buttons, among other options. The appearance attribute offers a hint as to which rendering might be most appropriate, although any styling information (such as CSS) should take precedence. This element is used within selection form controls to group available choices. This provides the same functionality as element optgroup in HTML. Common Attributes: Common  This element specifies the storage value and label to represent an item in a list. It is found within elements select1 and select, or grouped in element choices. Common Attributes: Common This element provides a storage value to be used when an item is selected. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (optional) Data Binding Restriction: All lexical values must be valid according to the datatype bound to the selection control. If inline content and a Single Node Binding are both specified, the Single Node Binding is used.  The child elements detailed below provide the ability to attach metadata to form controls. Instead of supplying such metadata e.g., the label for a form control as inline content of the contained element label, the metadata can be pointed to by using a simple linking attribute src on these elements. Notice that systematic use of this feature can be exploited in internationalizing XForms user interfaces by: Factoring all human readable messages to a separate resource XML file. Using URIs into this XML resource bundle within individual label elements Finally, an XForms implementation could use content negotiation to obtain the appropriate XML resource bundle, e.g., based on the accept-language headers from the client, to serve up the user interface with messages localized to the client's locale. Binding attributes on optional element filename specify the location in the instance for the parent element upload, when activated, to place the filename for the chosen binary resource. For security reasons, upload must not take action due to any existing value of the node. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding In the following example, the user is prompted to select an image. When activated, upload places in mail/attachment either the binary data of the image or a URI for it, depending on the type declared for the mail/attachment. The filename, perhaps "me.jpg", is placed in the attribute node mail/attachment@filename, and the mediatype, perhaps "image/jpeg" in the attribute node mail/attachment@mediatype. Example: Binding attributes on optional element mediatype specify the location in the instance for the parent element upload, when activated, to place the mediatype of the chosen binary resource, if available. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding This required element labels the containing form control with a descriptive label. Additionally, the label makes it possible for someone who can't see the form control to obtain a short description while navigating between form controls. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (optional) Special Attributes:  Link to external label. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an error (4.5.3 The xforms-link-error Event). The label specified can exist in instance data, in a remote document, or as inline text. If more than one source of label is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes, linking attributes, inline text. An accessibility aid might speak the metadata encapsulated here when the containing form control gets focus.  The optional element help provides a convenient way to attach help information to a form control.  Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (optional) Special Attributes:  Link to external help information. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an error (4.5.3 The xforms-link-error Event). The message specified can exist in instance data, in a remote document, or as inline text. If more than one source of message is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes, linking attributes, inline text. An example of this element is at 10.1.12 The message Element.  The optional element hint provides a convenient way to attach hint information to a form control.  Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (optional) Special Attributes:  Link to external hint. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an error (4.5.3 The xforms-link-error Event). The message specified can exist in instance data, in a remote document, or as inline text. If more than one source of message is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes, linking attributes, inline text. An example of this element is at 10.1.12 The message Element.  The optional element alert provides a convenient way to attach alert or error information to a form control. Rendering of this element is implementation-defined, and there is no default level such as modal or ephemeral for the displayed message. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (optional) Special Attributes:  Link to external alert. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an error (4.5.3 The xforms-link-error Event). The message specified can exist in instance data, in a remote document, or as inline text. If more than one source of message is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes, linking attributes, inline text. See F XForms and Styling for examples to see how this might be presented to the user. This chapter covers XForms features for combining form controls into user interfaces.  All form controls defined in 8 Form Controls are treated as individual units for purposes of visual layout e.g., in XHTML processing. Aggregation of form controls with markup defined in this chapter provides semantics about the relationship among user interface controls; such knowledge can be useful in delivering a coherent UI to small devices. For example, if the user interface needs to be split up over several screens, controls appearing inside the same aggregation would typically be rendered on the same screen or page. The elements and attributes included in this module are: the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to empty nodeset, the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to a non-relevant instance node, the group is contained by a non-relevant switch or group (which includes a non-relevant repeat item), or the group is contained by a non-selected case element of a switch. The optional label element has special significance when it appears as the first element child of group, representing a label for the entire group. Example: Setting the input focus on a group results in the focus being set to the first form control in the navigation order within that group. This section defines a switch construct that allows the creation of user interfaces where the user interface can be varied based on user actions and events. The elements and attributes included in this module are:  This element contains one or more case elements, any one of which is rendered at a given time. This is separate from XForms relevant processing (see 6.1.4 The relevant Property), which is based on the current state of the XForms Model. As an example, portions of a questionnaire pertaining to the user's automobile may become relevant only if the user has answered in the affirmative to the question 'Do you own a car?'. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding (optional) Example: The above results in the portion of the user interface contained in the first case being displayed initially. This prompts for the user's name; filling in a value and activating the control e.g., by pressing enter results switches to the alternate case, with a read-only output rendering. Activating the trigger labeled "Edit" in turn switches back to the original case. Common Attributes: Common Special Attributes: Optional selection status for the case. The default value is "false". If multiple cases within a switch are marked as selected="true", the first selected case remains and all others are deselected. If none are selected, the first becomes selected. This XForms Action selects one possible case from an exclusive list of alternatives in a switch. This action  performs the following: Dispatches an xforms-deselect event to the currently selected case  in the switch containing the identified case. Adjusts the selected states (not the attribute values) on the affected cases to reflect the new state of the switch containing the identified case. Dispatches an xform-select event to the case just selected. Common Attributes: Common, Events Special Attributes: Required reference to a case element.   The XForms specification allows the definition of repeating structures such as multiple items within a purchase order. When defining the XForms Model, such higher-level collections are constructed out of basic building blocks; similarly, this section defines user interface construct repeat that can bind to data structures such as lists and collections. The elements and attributes included in this module are: For example:  Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Node Set Binding Special Attributes: Optional 1-based initial value of the repeat index. The default value is 1. Optional hint to the XForms Processor as to how many elements from the collection to display.  This element operates over a homogeneous collection by binding the encapsulated user interface controls to each element of the collection. if an element of the collection is non-relevant, then the rendering approach used to signify non-relevance is applied to the associated user interface controls. Attributes on this element specify how many members of the collection are presented to the user at any given time. XForms Actions insert, delete, and setindex can be used to operate on the collection&mdash;see 10 XForms Actions. Another way to view repeat processing (disregarding special user interface interactions) is to consider "unrolling" the repeat. The above example is similar to the following (given four item elements in the returned node-set):  Element repeat enables the creation of user interfaces for populating repeating structures. When using XForms within host languages like XHTML, it is often necessary to create repeating structures within constructs such as table. Thus, one might wish to use element repeat within a table to create the rows of a table, where each row of the table binds to a distinct member of a homogeneous collection. Since html:table doesn't (and probably never will) allow xforms:repeat elements as children, another syntax is needed. More generally, there is a need to integrate repeat behavior into host languages at points where the content model of the host language does not or cannot provide the appropriate extension hooks via modularization. To accommodate this, XForms 1.0 defines an alternative syntax that is functionally equivalent to the repeat element, using the following attributes:   repeat-model  repeat-bind  repeat-nodeset  repeat-startindex  repeat-number    The above attributes are equivalent to the repeat attributes of the same name, but without the prefix repeat-. A host language can include these attributes in the appropriate places to enable repeating constructs. For example, a version of XHTML might use: Which could be validated against an appropriately configured XHTML Schema that includes the XForms Repeat module. Note that what gets repeated is the child elements of the element with the repeat- attributes. Additionally, when using XForms Action setindex, attribute repeat of type idref can point to any element carrying the repeat attributes. Similarly, when using function index against a repeating structure created via the repeat-attributes, the id of that element can be used as the argument to function index. This element allows the creation of dynamic selections within controls select and select1, where the available choices are determined at run-time. The node-set that holds the available choices is specified via  the Node Set Binding. As with repeat, this nodeset should refer to a homogeneous collection. Child elements label and value indirectly specify the label and storage values. Notice that the run-time effect of itemset is the same as using element choices with child item elements  to statically author the available choices. For each node of the Node Set Binding, an associated item is created.  XForms Actions appearing in the content of an itemset are created within each item element, and the in-scope evaluation context for these XForms Actions is based on the node for which the item was generated as described in Section 7.4 Evaluation Context. An XForms processor must not allow XForms Actions contained by an itemset to handle events on the itemset. Common Attributes: Common, Node Set Binding Whenever a refresh event is dispatched the nodeset is re-evaluated to update the list of available choices.  The following example shows element itemset within control select to specify a dynamic list of ice cream flavors: Structurally, this element is similar to 8.2.3 The value Element. It differs in that it can only be used within itemset, and that it works with subtrees of instance data rather than simple values. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (optional) When an item becomes selected, the following rules apply: The target node, selected by the binding attributes on the list form control, must be an element node, otherwise an exception results (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). The element node associated with the item, selected by the binding attributes on copy, is deep copied as a child of the target node. A full computational dependency rebuild is done. When an item becomes unselected, the following rules apply: The target node, selected by the binding attributes on the list form control, must be an element node, otherwise an exception results (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). The child element node associated with the item, selected by the binding attributes on copy, is deleted. A full computational dependency rebuild. This action is used to insert new entries into a homogeneous collection, e.g., a set of items in a shopping cart. Attributes of action insert specify the insertion in terms of the collection in which a new entry is to be inserted, and the location within that collection where the new node will appear. The new node is created by cloning the final member of the homogeneous collection. In this process, nodes of type xsd:ID are modified to remain as unique values in the instance data. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Node Set Binding Special Attributes: Required XPath expression evaluated to determine insert location. Required selector ("before" or "after") of insert before/after behavior. The rules for insert processing are as follows: The homogeneous collection to be updated is determined by evaluating the Node Set Binding. if the collection is empty, the insert action has no effect. The node-set binding identifies a homogeneous collection in the instance data. The final member of this collection is cloned to produce the node that will be inserted. Finally, this newly created node is inserted into the instance data at the location specified by attributes position and at.  Attribute at is evaluated to determine the insertion index &ndash; a numerical value that is the index into the node-set. The attribute at is evaluated with the first node in document order from the node set binding as the context node, the size of the node set binding as the context size and 1 as the context position. Attribute position specifies whether the new node is inserted before or after this index. The rules for selecting the index are as follows: The return value of the XPath expression in attribute at is processed according to the rules of the XPath function round(). For example, the literal 1.5 becomes 2, and the literal 'string' becomes NaN. If the result is NaN, the insert appends to the end of the node-set. If the resulting index is outside the valid range of the node-set, it is replaced with either 1 or the size of the node-set, whichever is closer. The index for any repeating sequence that is bound to the homogeneous collection where the node was added is updated to point to the newly added node. The indexes for inner nested repeat collections are re-initialized to startindex. If the insert is successful, the event xforms-insert is dispatched.  This action results in the insertion of newly created data nodes into the XForms instance data. Such nodes are constructed as defined in the initialization section of the processing model&mdash;see 4.2 Initialization Events. As an example, this causes the instantiation of the necessary user interface for populating a new entry in the underlying collection when used in conjunction with repeating structures.  This action has special deferred update behavior. An example of using insert with a repeating structure is located at 9.3.1 The repeat Element. Note that XForms Action setvalue can be used in conjunction with insert to provide initial values for the newly inserted nodes.  This action deletes nodes from the instance data. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Node Set Binding Special Attributes: Required XPath expression evaluated to determine delete location. The rules for delete processing are as follows: The homogeneous collection to be updated is determined by evaluating the Node Set Binding. If the collection is empty, the delete action has no effect. The n-th element node is deleted from the instance data, where n represents the number returned from node-set index evaluation, defined in 9.3.5 The insert Element. If no nth node exists, the operation has no effect.  The index should point to the same node after a delete as it did before the delete except: When the last remaining item in the collection is removed, the index position becomes 0. When the index was pointing to the deleted node, which was the last item in the collection, the index will point to the new last node of the collection and the index of inner repeats is reinitialized. When the index was pointing to the deleted node, which was not the last item in the collection, the index position is not changed and the index of inner repeats is re-initialized. If the delete is successful, the event xforms-delete is dispatched.  This action results in deletion of nodes in the instance data. This action has special deferred update behavior. An example of using delete with a repeating structure is located at 9.3.1 The repeat Element.  This action marks a specific item as current in a repeating sequence (within 9.3.1 The repeat Element). Common Attributes: Common, Events Special Attributes: Required reference to a repeating element. If the selected index is 0 or less, an xforms-scroll-first event is dispatched and the index is set to 1. If the selected index is greater than the index of the last repeat item, an xforms-scroll-last event is dispatched and the index is set to that of the last item. if the index evaluates to NaN the action has no effect. The indexes for inner nested repeat collections are re-initialized to startindex. The implementation data structures for tracking computational dependencies are rebuilt or updated as a result of this action.  The markup contained within the body of element repeat specifies the user interface to be generated for each member of the underlying collection. During user interface initialization (see 4.2.2 The xforms-model-construct-done Event), the following steps are performed for repeat: The Node Set Binding is evaluated to locate the homogeneous collection to be operated on by this repeat.  The index for this repeating structure is initialized to the value of startindex. if the initial startindex is less than 1 it defaults to 1. If the index is greater than the initial node-set then it defaults to the size of the node-set.  User interface as specified by the repeat is generated for the requisite number of members of the collection as specified by attributes on element repeat.   The processing model for repeating structures uses an index that points to the current item in the instance data. This repeat index is accessed via XForms function index 7.8.5 The index() Function and manipulated via XForms Action setindex 9.3.7 The setindex Element. This index is used as a reference point for insert and delete operations. Notice that the contained XForms form controls inside element repeat do not explicitly specify the index of the collection entry being populated. This is intentional; it keeps both authoring as well as the processing model simple.  The binding expression attached to the repeating sequence returns a node-set of the collection being populated, not an individual node. Within the body of element repeat, binding expressions are evaluated with a context node of the node determined by the index. Repeat processing uses XPath expressions to address the collection over which element repeat operates.   The form controls appearing inside repeat need to be suitable for populating individual items of the collection. A simple but powerful consequence of the above is that if the XForms Model specifies nested collections, then a corresponding user interface can nest repeat elements.   It is possible to nest repeat elements to create more powerful user interface for editing structured data. G.2 Editing Hierarchical Bookmarks Using XForms is an example of a form using nested repeats to edit hierarchical data consisting of bookmarks within multiple sections. Consider the following insert statement that appears as part of that example.   The above insert statement is used in that example to add new bookmark entries into the currently selected section. The inner (nested) repeat operates on bookmarks in this selected section; The index&mdash;as returned by XForms function index&mdash;for this inner repeat starts at 1. Hence, after a new empty section of bookmarks is created and becomes current, the first insert bookmark operation adds the newly created bookmark at the front of the list.  Element repeat enables the binding of user interaction to a homogeneous collection. The number of displayed items might be less than the total number available in the collection. In this case, the presentation would render only a portion of the repeating items at a given time. For example, a graphical user interface might present a scrolling table. The current item indicated by the repeat index should be made available to the user at all times, for example, not allowed to scroll out of view. The XForms Actions enumerated at 10 XForms Actions may be used within event listeners to manipulate the homogeneous collection being populated by scrolling, inserting, and deleting entries.  Notice that the markup encapsulated by element repeat acts as the template for the user interface that is presented to the user. As a consequence, statically authored IDREF attributes must be interpreted based on a combination of repeat indexes and where the IDREF attributes appear relative to the element bearing the matching ID. Based on the IDREF resolution rules given in 4.7 Resolving ID References in XForms, it is possible to toggle the case of a switch even when it is within one or more repeat elements.  Similarly, it is possible to set the focus to controls and dispatch events to elements that are within one or more repeat elements. If the focus is transferred to a control within a repeat by any means, such as by an XForms action or by user interaction, the index of the repeat is changed to indicate the item of the homogeneous collection that contains the control. This effect is recursive; the index of each containing repeat is adjusted appropriately. This chapter defines an XML Events-based [XML Events] common set of actions that can be invoked in response to events.  XForms itself defines no method for script-based event handling. The definition of such facilities is a responsibility of the hosting language.  All form controls defined in this specification have a set of common behaviors that encourage consistent authoring and look and feel for XForms-based applications. This consistency comes from attaching a common set of behaviors to the various form controls. In conjunction with the event binding mechanism provided by XML Events, these handlers provide a flexible means for forms authors to specify event processing at appropriate points within the XForms user interface. XForms Actions are declarative XML event handlers that capture high-level semantics. As a consequence, they significantly enhance the accessibility of XForms-based applications in comparison to previous Web technologies that relied exclusively on scripting. The elements and attributes included in this module are: See also: 9.2.3 The toggle Element; 9.3.5 The insert Element; 9.3.6 The delete Element; and 9.3.7 The setindex Element. Additionally, this module defines the attribute group "XML Events", which includes all of the "global" attributes defined in that specification ([XML Events]). The following example shows how events can be used: This example recreates the behavior of the HTML reset control, which this specification does not define as an independent form control.  For each built-in XForms Action, this chapter lists the following: NameCommon AttributesSpecial AttributesDescription of behavior All elements defined in this chapter explicitly allow global attributes from the XML Events namespace, and apply the processing defined in that specification in section 2.3 [XML Events]. Execution of an outermost action handler begins by setting the XForms processor into the state of executing an outermost action handler.  The outermost action handler is then performed, which may include the execution of inner action handlers.  Finally, the XForms processor is set into the state of not executing an outermost action handler and then the deferred update is performed for each model.  The deferred update behavior for a model consists of examining each deferred update Boolean flag in the order of rebuild, recalculate, revalidate, and refresh, and for each true flag, set the flag to false and then dispatch the proper event to the model for that deferred update flag (i.e. dispatch xforms-rebuild for a true rebuild flag, xforms-recalculate for a true recalculate flag, xforms-revalidate for a true revalidate flag, and xforms-refresh for a true refresh flag). The XForms processor is not considered to be executing an outermost action handler at the time that it performs deferred update behavior for XForms models.  Therefore, event handlers for events dispatched to the user interface during the deferred refresh behavior are considered to be new outermost action handler. Actions that directly invoke rebuild, recalculate, revalidate, or refresh always have an immediate effect, and clear the corresponding deferred update flag. The XForms Actions in this category are: rebuildrecalculaterevalidaterefresh XForms Actions that change the tree structure of instance data result in setting all four deferred update flags to true  for the model over which they operate. The XForms Actions in this category are: insertdelete XForms Actions that change only the value of an instance node results in setting the deferred update flags for recalculate, revalidate, and refresh to true and making no change to the deferred update flag for rebuild  for the model over which they operate. The XForms Actions in this category are: setvalue Finally, the reset action clears all of the deferred update flags for a model. Similarly, if the default processing of xforms-submit replaces instance data in a model, then the deferred update flags for that model are cleared immediately before the behaviors are peformed for xforms-rebuild, xforms-recalculate, xforms-revalidate, and xforms-refresh. This action causes its child actions to be invoked in the order that they are specified in the document. Common Attributes: Common, Events This action dispatches an XForms Event to a specific element identified by the target attribute. Two kinds of event can be dispatched:  Predefined XForms events (i.e., xforms-event-name), in which case the bubbles and cancelable attributes are ignored and the standard semantics as defined in 4 Processing Model apply. An event created by the XForms author with no predefined XForms semantics and as such not handled by default by the XForms Processor. Common Attributes: Common, Events Special Attributes: Required name of the event to dispatch. Required reference to the event target. Optional boolean indicating if this event bubbles&mdash;as defined in [DOM2 Events]. The default value  is true for a custom event. For predefined events, this attribute has no effect. Optional boolean indicating if this event is cancelable&mdash;as defined in [DOM2 Events]. The default value  is true for a custom event. For predefined events, this attribute has no effect. This action causes the processing of xforms-rebuild to happen, bypassing the normal event flow  (i.e. the behavior occurs without dispatching the xforms-rebuild event). This action results in the XForms Processor rebuilding any internal data structures used to track computational dependencies among instance data nodes &mdash;see 4.3.7 The xforms-rebuild Event. Common Attributes: Common, Events Special Attributes:  This action has special deferred update behavior. This action causes the processing of xforms-recalculate to happen, bypassing the normal event flow  (i.e. the behavior occurs without dispatching the xforms-recalculate event). As a result, instance data nodes whose values need to be recalculated are updated as specified in the processing model&mdash;see 4.3.6 The xforms-recalculate Event. Common Attributes: Common, Events Special Attributes:  This action has special deferred update behavior. This action causes the processing of xforms-revalidate to happen, bypassing the normal event flow  (i.e. the behavior occurs without dispatching the xforms-revalidate event). This results in the instance data being revalidated as specified by the processing model&mdash;see 4.3.5 The xforms-revalidate Event. Common Attributes: Common, Events Special Attributes:  This action has special deferred update behavior. This action causes the processing of xforms-refresh to happen, bypassing the normal event flow  (i.e. the behavior occurs without dispatching the xforms-refresh event). This action results in the XForms user interface being refreshed, and the presentation of user interface controls being updated to reflect the state of the underlying instance data&mdash;see 4.3.4 The xforms-refresh Event. Common Attributes: Common, Events Special Attributes:  This action has special deferred update behavior. Common Attributes: Common, Events Special Attributes: Required reference to a form control. Setting focus to a repeating structure sets the focus to the repeat item represented by the repeat index.  This action traverses the specified link. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Single-Node Binding (optional) Special Attributes: Optional. Link to external resource to load, defined as an [XLink 1.0] link between this element and the remote resource indicated. No XLink actuate value is defined, since control of actuation is defined by XML Events. The XLink show value depends on the show attribute. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an error (4.5.3 The xforms-link-error Event). Optional link behavior specifier. if this attribute is missing, a default value of "replace" is assumed. Either the Single-Node Binding attributes, pointing to a URI in the instance data, or the resource attribute is  required. If both the Single-Node Binding and the resource attributeare present, the action has no effect.  This action has no effect if the Single-Node Binding is present and does not select an instance data node. Possible values for attribute show have the following processing for the document (or portion of a document) reached by traversing the link: The document is loaded into a new presentation context, e.g., a new window. Form processing in the original window continues. The document is loaded into the current window. Form processing is interrupted, exactly as if the user had manually requested navigating to a new document. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Optional XPath expression to evaluate, with the result stored in the selected instance data node. The evaluation context for this XPath expression is the result from the Single Node Binding. The element content of setvalue specifies the literal value to set; this is an alternative to specifying a computed value via attribute value. The following two examples contrast these approaches: This causes the string value at a/b/c in the instance data to be placed on the single node selected by the bind element with id="put-here". This causes the value "literal string" to be placed on the single node selected by the bind element with id="put-here". If neither a value attribute nor text content are present, the effect is to set the value of the selected node to the empty string (""). If both are present, the value attribute is used. All strings are inserted into the instance data as follows: Element nodes: If the element has any child text nodes, the first text node is replaced with one corresponding to the new value. If no child text nodes are present, a text node is created, corresponding to the new value, and appended as the first child node. Attribute nodes: The string-value of the attribute is replaced with a string corresponding to the new value. Text nodes: The text node is replaced with a new one corresponding to the new value. Namespace, processing instruction, comment, and the XPath root node: behavior is undefined.  This action has special deferred update behavior. This action initiates submit processing by dispatching an xforms-submit event. Processing of event xforms-submit is defined in the processing model&mdash;see 4.3.9 The xforms-submit Event. Common Attributes: Common, Events Special Attributes: Required reference to a submission element. This XForms Action is a convenient way of expressing the following: This action initiates reset processing by dispatching an xforms-reset event to the specified model. Processing of event xforms-reset is defined in the processing model&mdash;see 4.3.8 The xforms-reset Event. Common Attributes: Common, Events Special Attributes:  This action has special deferred update behavior.  This action encapsulates a message to be displayed to the user. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Single Node Binding (optional) Special Attributes: Link to external message. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an error (4.5.3 The xforms-link-error Event). Required message level identifier, one of ("ephemeral"|"modeless"|"modal"|QNameButNotNCNAME). This specification does not define behavior for QName values. The message specified can exist in instance data, in a remote document, or as inline text. If more than one source of message is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes, linking attributes, inline text. The user interface for the message action is considered to be created at the time the action occurs.  If the message is obtained from the inline content of the message action, then the output of any output controls in the message content is determined based on the instance data available when the message action occurs.  For example, the following example displays the message Hello, world! as the form starts up: In this example, the message includes the latest user input even though other form controls not in the message action are not guaranteed to be updated until the end of the xforms-refresh event processing: Due to deferred update behavior, if a message action is preceded in an action sequence by other actions that change instance nodes, and the message references nodes that are computationally dependent on the changed nodes, then the form author should invoke the recalculate action before the message action. A graphical browser might render a modal message as follows:   A modeless message is the foundation for displaying a help message, which a graphical browser might render as follows:    An ephemeral message is the foundation for displaying a hint message, which a graphical browser might render as follows:     In addition to the action handlers detailed in this chapter, XForms defines three actions as part of the XForms Repeat module: 9.3.5 The insert Element, 9.3.6 The delete Element, and 9.3.7 The setindex Element. XForms is designed to gather instance data, serialize it into an external representation, and submit it with a protocol. XForms defines a set of options for serialization and submission. The following sections define the processing of instance data for submission, and the behavior for the serialization and submission options. Submission begins with the default action for a xforms-submit event. Target: submission Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None Under no circumstances may more than a single concurrent submit process be under way for a particular XForms submission. From the start of the default action of xforms-submit, until the completion of the default action for xforms-submit-done or xforms-submit-error, the default action for subsequent xforms-submit events is to do nothing. Otherwise, the  default action for this event results in the following steps: Selected instance data is serialized according to the rules stated at 11.2 Submission Options. Serialized instance data is submitted using the protocol indicated by the rules stated at 11.2 Submission Options. The response returned from the submission is applied as follows:  For a success response including a body, when the value of the replace attribute on element submission is "all", the event xforms-submit-done is dispatched, and submit processing concludes with entire containing document being replaced with the returned body. For a success response including a body of a non-XML media type (i.e. with a content type not matching any of the specifiers in [RFC 3023]), when the value of the replace attribute on element submission is "instance", nothing in the document is replaced and submit processing concludes after dispatching xforms-submit-error. For a success response including a body, when the value of the replace attribute on element submission is "none", submit processing concludes after dispatching xforms-submit-done. For a success response not including a body, submit processing concludes after dispatching xforms-submit-done. Behaviors of other possible values for attribute replace are not defined in this specification. For an error response nothing in the document is replaced, and submit processing concludes after dispatching xforms-submit-error. The XForms Model specifies a submission element containing the following attributes that affect serialization and submission. This section summarizes the behaviors for the allowable values of these attributes, and introduces the following sections that define the behavior for serialization and submission. (See 3.3.3 The submission Element for additional submission attributes that affect serialization.)  action (xsd:anyURI) method (xsd:string, enumerated below) For the URI scheme of action, XForms normatively defines a binding to HTTP/1.1 [RFC 2616]. Other bindings, in particular to the URI scheme "mailto:" may, and the schemes "https:" and "file:" should, be supported. Bindings to these schemes are not normatively defined in XForms. Implementations that choose to provide a binding to these schemes should pay particular attention to privacy and security concerns. Within the "http:" and "https:" schemes, form creators are encouraged to follow the finding of the W3C Technical Architecture Group on when to use the GET method: [TAG Finding 7] The method attribute determines the serialization format, and the URI scheme used in the action attribute determines the submit protocol, according to the following table: Foreign-namespaced attributes are allowed on element submission, but no behavior is defined by XForms 1.0. This format permits the expression of the instance data as XML that is straightforward to process with off-the-shelf XML processing tools. In addition, this format is capable of submission of binary content. The steps for serialization are as follows: An XML document is produced following the rules of the XML output method defined in [XSLT 1.0] section 16 and 16.1, using the values supplied as attributes of the submission element. Handling of namespace nodes: The default behavior is that every namespace node is serialized according to the rules of the XML output method, so that at least one namespace declaration appears in the serialized XML for each in-scope namespace. Additional inherited namespaces are declared on the root element of the serialized XML. If, however, attribute includenamespaceprefixes on element submission is present, then all namespace declarations not visibly utilized in the instance data (as defined in [Exc-C14N]) and the default namespace if it is empty are excluded from the root element serialization, unless the corresponding namespace prefix is listed in the includenamespaceprefixes attribute. The special value #default represents the default namespace.  Mediatype: By default, the mediatype of the serialized XML instance is application/xml, but can be changed to a compatible type using element submission attribute mediatype. Authors should ensure that the type specified is compatible with application/xml. This format is intended for integration of XForms into environments that involve large amounts of binary data where the inclusion of the data as xsd:base64Binary or xsd:hexBinary is undesirable. In this format, XML instance data is serialized as one part of the [RFC 2387] multipart/related message, using the rules as described in 11.3 Serialization as application/xml. Binary content from xsd:anyURI instance nodes populated by the upload (see 8.1.6 The upload Element) control is serialized in separate parts of the [RFC 2387] multipart/related message. This format follows the rules of multipart/related MIME data streams for in [RFC 2387], with specific requirements of this serialization listed below: multipart/related message header requirements: Must contain a type parameter of the mediatype of the serialized XML instance. Must contain a start parameter referring to the Content-ID first body part (root). First body part (root) requirements: Must have Content-Type parameter of the type specified by the submission mediatype attribute. Content is serialized by the rules at 11.3 Serialization as application/xml. Subsequent part requirements: One part for each node with a datatype of xsd:anyURI populated by upload with: A Content-Type header that represents the type of the attachment if known, otherwise application/octet-stream. A Content-Transfer-Encoding header. A Content-ID header whose value matches the URI in the associated instance data node. The binary content associated with the URI, serialized according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding heading. This format is for legacy compatibility to permit the use of XForms clients with [RFC 2388] servers. This method is suitable for the persistence of binary content. Contextual path information, attribute values, namespaces and namespace prefixes are not preserved. As a result, different elements might serialize to the same name. Existing HTML user agents fail to encode special characters (such as double quotes) and non-ASCII characters in the Content-Disposition: form-data name and filename parameters. Since this serialization method is supported for legacy applications only, new applications should use application/xml or multipart/related.  This format follows the rules for multipart/form-data MIME data streams in [RFC 2388], with specific requirements of this serialization listed below: Each element node is visited in document order. Each element that has exactly one text node child is selected for inclusion. Element nodes selected for inclusion are as encoded as Content-Disposition: form-data MIME parts as defined in [RFC 2387], with the name parameter being the element local name. Element nodes of any datatype populated by upload are serialized as the specified content and additionally have a Content-Disposition filename parameter, if available. The Content-Type must be text/plain except for xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary, and derived types, in which case the header represents the media type of the attachment if known, otherwise application/octet-stream. If a character set is applicable, the Content-Type may have a charset parameter. Example: This format represents an extension of the [XHTML 1.0] form content type application/x-www-form-urlencoded with specific rules for encoding non-ASCII and reserved characters. This format is not suitable for the persistence of binary content. Therefore, it is recommended that forms capable of containing binary content use another serialization method. The steps for serialization are as follows: Each element node is visited in document order. Each element that has one text node child is selected for inclusion. Note that attribute information is not preserved. Element nodes selected for inclusion are encoded as EltName=value, where = is a literal character, EltName represents the element local name, and value represents the contents of the text node. The separator character {sep} from the separator attribute on submission is used between pairs of encoded name/value pairs, e.g. EltName1=value1{sep}EltName2=value2{sep}EltName3=value3. Note that contextual path information is not preserved, nor are namespaces or namespace prefixes. As a result, different elements might serialize to the same name. The encoding of EltName and value are as follows: space characters are replaced by +, and then non-ASCII and reserved characters (as defined by [RFC 2396] as amended by subsequent documents in the IETF track) are escaped by replacing the character with one or more octets of the UTF-8 representation of the character, with each octet in turn replaced by %HH, where HH represents the uppercase hexadecimal notation for the octet value and % is a literal character. Line breaks are represented as "CR LF" pairs (i.e., %0D%0A).  All such encodings are concatenated, maintaining document order. Example: This format consists of simple name-value pairs. Here is the instance data for the above example. Note that very little of the data is preserved. Authors desiring greater data integrity should select a different serialization format. These submit methods represent HTTP POST or the equivalent concept (such as a mail message). The serialized form data is delivered as the message body. This submit method represents HTTP PUT or the equivalent concept (such as writing to a local file). The serialized form data is delivered as the message body. This submit method represents HTTP GET or the equivalent concept. The serialized form data is delivered as part of the URI that is requested during the submit process. This method is not suitable for submission of forms that are intended to change state or cause other actions to take place at the server. See [RFC 2616] for recommended uses of HTTP GET. The URI is constructed as follows: The submit URI from the action attribute is examined. If it does not already contain a ? (question mark) character, one is appended. If it does already contain a question mark character, then a separator character from the attribute separator is appended. The serialized form data is appended to the URI. No message body is sent with the request. The XForms specification is intended for implementation on hardware platforms of all sizes, from tiny hand-held devices to high-powered servers. For this reason, a separate document is being developed to describe a conformance profile of XForms that can be processed with fewer resources.  This conformance level is suitable for more powerful forms processing, such as might be found on a standard desktop browser or a distributed XForms Processor involving server-side components. XForms Full implementations must return "full" from the property method (defined at 7.9.1  The property() Function ) called with the "conformance-level" parameter string. All XForms Processors must conform to the following specifications, except as qualified below:  [XML 1.0] [XML Names] [XML Events] [XPath 1.0] Implementing all features. [XML Schema part 2] All XForms Processors must fully support the following XForms modules: Core; MustUnderstand; Form Controls; Group; Switch; Repeat; and Action. All XForms Processors must also support: the XForms Processing Model and all events listed at 4 Processing Model; the http scheme for processing xsd:anyURI; all serialization methods defined at 11  Submit. A host language may introduce additional conformance requirements. XForms Full Processors must implement all required features defined in this specification. All XForms Containing Documents must conform to the following specifications, except as qualified below: [XML 1.0] [XML Names] [XML Events] [XML Schema part 2] XForms elements are typically inserted into a containing document in multiple places. The root element for each individual fragment must be model, a form control, group, repeat, or switch. Individual XForms fragments must be schema-valid against the Schema for XForms (A Schema for XForms). A host language may introduce additional conformance requirements. All XForms Full conforming documents must conform to all required portions of this specification. XForms generators must generate conforming XForms documents.

In the future, mechanisms may be specified for associating P3P policies with content transmitted over other protocols.  P3P allows for policies to be associated with an individual URI or a set of URIs. By associating a separate policy with each URI a site can declare a very precise policy that addresses exactly what data is collected with a particular HTTP request and how that data will be used. However, site management is substantially easier for many sites if they declare a single policy that covers many URIs, or even their entire Web presence.  The P3P specification specifies several methods for referencing a P3P policy reference file, which in turn associates P3P policies with URIs and cookies. XForms can be P3P enabled using any of the methods that are appropriate for the Web site in which they are embedded. Some special considerations regarding forms are addressed in the P3P Specification. [P3P 1.0]  Different P3P policies may be applied to the representation of a form embedded in a containing document to that which is associated with the data submitted via that form. If the form representation is served from a different server than the form is submitted to, it is likely that separate P3P policy reference files and policies will be needed. Typically the form representation causes only clickstream data (as defined in [P3P 1.0] section 5.6.4) to be transferred, while a form submission causes much more data to be transferred.  XForms Processors are free (and encouraged) to skip or optimize any steps in this algorithm, as long as the end result is the same. The XForms recalculation algorithm considers model items and model item properties to be vertices in a directed graph. Edges between the vertices represent computational dependencies between vertices. Following is the default handling for a recalculate action. Action recalculate is defined in 10.1.4 The recalculate Element. A master dependency directed graph is created as detailed in D.1 Details on Creating the Master Dependency Directed Graph. To provide consistent behavior, implementations must reduce the number of vertices to be processed by computing a pertinent dependency subgraph consisting only of vertices and edges that are reachable from nodes that require recomputation. This is detailed in D.2 Details on Creating the Pertinent Dependency Subgraph. Note that on a first recomputation (such as on form load), the pertinent dependency subgraph will be the same as the master dependency directed graph. A topological sort is performed on the vertices of the pertinent dependency subgraph, resulting in an order of evaluation in which each vertex is evaluated only after those vertices on which it depends and before all vertices which depend on it. The topological sort algorithm is discussed at [Algorithms]. The recalculate process completes. The master dependency directed graph can be considered an array with one record for each vertex, each having the following fields: InstanceNode: a reference to the associated instance data nodetype: indicates the aspect of the instance node represented by the vertex (the text content or a model item property such as readOnly or required)depList: a list of vertices that refer to this vertexin-degree: the number of vertices on which this vertex dependsvisited: a flag used to ensure vertices are not added to a subgraph multiple timesindex: an association between vertices in the master dependency directed graph and a subgraph The depList for each vertex is assigned to be the referenced XML nodes of a given instance node, which are obtained by parsing the computed expression in the node (e.g., the calculate, relevant, readonly, or required property). Any expression violating any Binding Expression Constraint causes an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-compute-exception Event), terminating the recalculate process. The depList for a vertex v is assigned to be the vertices other than v whose computational expressions reference v (described below). Vertex v is excluded from its own depList to allow self-references to occur without causing a circular reference exception. A computational expression appearing in a calculate attribute controls the text content (value) of one or more instance nodes. A vertex exists for each instance node to represent the expression in the context of the node. Likewise, computational expressions for model item properties such as readOnly and required are applied to one or more instance nodes, and vertices are created to represent such expressions in the context of each applicable node. The computational expression of each vertex must be examined to determine the XML nodes to which it refers. Any expression violating any Binding Expression Constraint causes an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-compute-exception Event), terminating the recalculate process. A computation expression refers to a vertex v if a subexpression indicates the InstanceNode for v and v represents the instance node text content (its value). In this version of XForms, model item properties such as readOnly and required cannot be referenced in an expression. If all calculations must be performed, which is the case on form load, then the pertinent dependency subgraph is simply a duplicate of the master dependency directed graph. If the recalculation algorithm is invoked with a list of changed instance data nodes since the last recalculation, then the pertinent dependency subgraph is obtained by exploring the paths of edges and vertices in the computational dependency directed graph that are reachable from each vertex in the change list. The method of path exploration can be depth first search, a suitable version of which appears in the pseudo-code below. This algorithm creates a pertinent dependency subgraph S from a list of changed instance data nodes L&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. Variables such as v and w represent vertices in the master dependency directed graph. The same variables ending with S indicate vertices in the pertinent dependency subgraph S. Note that the number of vertices and dependency nodes in the pertinent dependency subgraph is not known beforehand, but a method such as array doubling (see [DDJ-ArrayDoubling]) can be used to ensure that building the subgraph is performed in time linear in the size of S. The following steps process vertices, resulting in a recalculated form: A vertex with inDegree of 0 is selected for evaluation and removed from the pertinent dependency subgraph. In the case where more than one vertex has inDegree zero, no particular ordering is specified. If the pertinent dependency subgraph contains vertices, but none have an inDegree of 0, then the calculation structure of the form has a loop, and an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-compute-exception Event) must be thrown, terminating processing. If the vertex corresponds to a computed item, computed expressions are evaluated as follows: calculate: If the value of the model item changes, the corresponding instance data is updated and the dirty flag is set. relevant, readOnly, required, constraint: If any or all of these computed properties change, the new settings are immediately placed into effect for associated form controls. For each vertex in the depList of the removed vertex, decrement the inDegree by 1. If no vertices remain in the pertinent dependency subgraph, then the calculation has successfully completed. Otherwise, repeat this sequence from step 1. For example, consider six vertices a, b, v, w, x, and y. Let a and b represent the text content of instance nodes that will be set by a binding from user input controls. Let v and w be vertices representing the calculated value and the validity property of a third instance node c. These vertices would result from a bind element B with calculate and constraint attributes and a nodeset attribute that indicates c. Suppose that the value of c is the product of a and b and that the value is only valid if it does not exceed 100. Likewise, suppose x and y are vertices representing the calculated value and the validity property of a fourth instance node d. Let the value of d be the sum of a and b, and let d be valid if the value does not exceed 20. The figure below depicts the dependency digraph for this example.    Vertices a and b have edges leading to v and x because these vertices represent the calculate expressions of c and d, which reference a and b to compute their product and sum, respectively. Similarly, v and x have directed edges to w and y, respectively, because w and y represent the constraint expressions of c and d, which reference the values of c and d to compare them with boundary values. If a and b are initially equal to 10, and the user changes a to 11, then it is necessary to first recalculate v (the value of c) then recalculate w (the validity property of the value of c). Likewise, x (the value of d) must be recalculated before recalculating y (the validity property of the value of d). In both cases, the validity of the value does not change to false until after the new product and sum are computed based on the change to a. However, there are no interdependencies between v and x, so the product and sum could be computed in either order. The pertinent subgraph excludes b and only vertex a has in-degree of zero. The vertex a is processed first. It is not a computed vertex, so no recalculation occurs on a, but its removal causes v and x to have in-degree zero. Vertex v is processed second. Its value changes to 121, and its removal drops the in-degree of vertex w to zero. Vertex x is processed next, changing value to 21. When x is removed, its neighbor y drops to in-degree zero. The fourth and fifth iterations of this process recalculate the validity of w and y, both of which change to false. The attribute inputmode provides a hint to the user agent to select an appropriate input mode for the text input expected in an associated form control. The input mode may be a keyboard configuration, an input method editor (also called front end processor) or any other setting affecting input on the device(s) used.  Using inputmode, the author can give hints to the agent that make form input easier for the user. Authors should provide inputmode attributes wherever possible, making sure that the values used cover a wide range of devices. The value of the inputmode attribute is a white space separated list of tokens. Tokens are either sequences of alphabetic letters or absolute URIs. The later can be distinguished from the former by noting that absolute URIs contain a ':'. Tokens are case-sensitive. All the tokens consisting of alphabetic letters only are defined in this specification, in E.3 List of Tokens (or a successor of this specification). This specification does not define any URIs for use as tokens, but allows others to define such URIs for extensibility. This may become necessary for devices with input modes that cannot be covered by the tokens provided here. The URI should dereference to a human-readable description of the input mode associated with the use of the URI as a token. This description should describe the input mode indicated by this token, and whether and how this token modifies other tokens or is modified by other tokens. Upon entering an empty form control with an inputmode attribute, the user agent should select the input mode indicated by the inputmode attribute value. User agents should not use the inputmode attribute to set the input mode when entering a form control with text already present. To set the appropriate input mode when entering a form control that already contains text, user agents should rely on platform-specific conventions. User agents should make available all the input modes which are supported by the (operating) system/device(s) they run on/have access to, and which are installed for regular use by the user. This is typically only a small subset of the input modes that can be described with the tokens defined here. Additional guidelines for user agent implementation are found at [UAAG 1.0].  The following simple algorithm is used to define how user agents match the values of an inputmode attribute to the input modes they can provide. This algorithm does not have to be implemented directly; user agents just have to behave as if they used it. The algorithm is not designed to produce "obvious" or "desirable" results for every possible combination of tokens, but to produce correct behavior for frequent token combinations and predictable behavior in all cases. First, each of the input modes available is represented by one or more lists of tokens. An input mode may correspond to more than one list of tokens; as an example, on a system set up for a Greek user, both "greek upperCase" and "user upperCase" would correspond to the same input mode. No two lists will be the same. Second, the inputmode attribute is scanned from front to back. For each token t in the inputmode attribute, if in the remaining list of tokens representing available input modes there is any list of tokens that contains t, then all lists of tokens representing available input modes that do not contain t are removed. If there is no remaining list of tokens that contains t, then t is ignored. Third, if one or more lists of tokens are left, and they all correspond to the same input mode, then this input mode is chosen. If no list is left (meaning that there was none at the start) or if the remaining lists correspond to more than one input mode, then no input mode is chosen. Example: Assume the list of lists of tokens representing the available input modes is: {"cyrillic upperCase", "cyrillic lowerCase", "cyrillic", "latin", "user upperCase", "user lowerCase"}, then the following inputmode values select the following input modes: "cyrillic title" selects "cyrillic", "cyrillic lowerCase" selects "cyrillic lowerCase", "lowerCase cyrillic" selects "cyrillic lowerCase", "latin upperCase" selects "latin", but "upperCase latin" does select "cyrillic upperCase" or "user upperCase" if they correspond to the same input mode, and does not select any input mode if "cyrillic upperCase" and "user upperCase" do not correspond to the same input mode. Tokens defined in this specification are separated into two categories: Script tokens and modifiers. In inputmode attributes, script tokens should always be listed before modifiers. Script tokens provide a general indication the set of characters that is covered by an input mode. In most cases, script tokens correspond directly to [Unicode Scripts]. Some tokens correspond to the block names in Java class java.lang.Character.UnicodeBlock ([Java Unicode Blocks]) or Unicode Block names. However, this neither means that an input mode has to allow input for all the characters in the script or block, nor that an input mode is limited to only characters from that specific script. As an example, a "latin" keyboard doesn't cover all the characters in the Latin script, and includes punctuation which is not assigned to the Latin script. The version of the Unicode Standard that these script names are taken from is 3.2. Modifier tokens can be added to the scripts they apply in order to more closely specify the kind of characters expected in the form control. Traditional PC keyboards do not need most modifier tokens (indeed, users on such devices would be quite confused if the software decided to change case on its own; CAPS lock for upperCase may be an exception). However, modifier tokens can be very helpful to set input modes for small devices. User agents may use information available in an XML Schema pattern facet to set the input mode. Note that a pattern facet is a hard restriction on the lexical value of an instance data node, and can specify different restrictions for different parts of the data item. Attribute inputmode is a soft hint about the kinds of characters that the user may most probably start to input into the form control. Attribute inputmode is provided in addition to pattern facets for the following reasons: The set of allowable characters specified in a pattern may be so wide that it is not possible to deduce a reasonable input mode setting. Nevertheless, there frequently is a kind of characters that will be input by the user with high probability. In such a case, inputmode allows to set the input mode for the user's convenience. In some cases, it would be possible to derive the input mode setting from the pattern because the set of characters allowed in the pattern closely corresponds to a set of characters covered by an inputmode attribute value. However, such a derivation would require a lot of data and calculations on the user agent. Small devices may leave the checking of patterns to the server, but will easily be able to switch to those input modes that they support. Being able to make data entry for the user easier is of particular importance on small devices. This is an example of a form for Japanese address input. It is shown in table form; it will be replaced by actual syntax in a later version of this specification. This informative section provides a broad outline of new and existing CSS features needed to style XForms content. A future Recommendation from the CSS Working Group will fully develop the specification of these features. A CSS pseudo-class is used to select elements for styling based on information that lies outside of the document tree or that cannot be expressed using the other selectors. This list is not exhaustive; other pseudo-classes may be defined. Pseudo-elements are abstractions about the document tree beyond those specified by the document language. Pseudo-elements do not appear in the DOM; they are used only for purposes of styling. This list is not exhaustive; other pseudo-elements may be defined. The following examples show how basic styling can be accomplished on form controls and repeating structures.  This section presents complete XForms examples. These and additional examples are maintained at http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/2002/Examples. Schema file payschema.xsd: Initial instance file bookmarks.xml: The following example shows one possible way of integrating XForms with [SVG 1.1]. Note that the complete set of rules for integrating XForms and SVG are not fully specified at the time this specification was published. Future versions of the XForms, SVG, or other W3C specifications might define more complete rules for integrating XForms and SVG which might not be compatible with the example below. Note that the example below does not use SVG's switch and requiredExtensions features, which are commonly used in conjunction with foreignObject.

Raman, Google - XForms 1.0 First and Second Editions An introduction to XForms. The introduction outlines the design principles and includes a brief tutorial on XForms.  XForms reference manual. The bulk of the reference manual consists of the specification of XForms. This reference defines XForms and how XForms Processors must interpret the various components in order to claim conformance.  Appendixes contain a normative description of XForms described in XML Schema, information on references, and other useful information.  Reference - linked to from above. Submitted data is strongly typed and can be checked using off-the-shelf tools. This speeds up form filling since it reduces the need for round trips to the server for validation. This obviates the need for custom server-side logic to marshal the submitted data to the application back-end. The received XML instance document can be directly validated and processed by the application back-end. This obviates duplication, and ensures that updating the validation rules as a result of a change in the underlying business logic does not require re-authoring validation constraints within the XForms application. This enables the XForms author to go beyond the basic set of constraints available from the back-end. Providing such additional constraints as part of the XForms Model enhances the overall usability of the resulting Web application. Using XML 1.0 for instance data ensures that the submitted data is internationalization ready. XForms separates content and presentation. User interface controls encapsulate all relevant metadata such as labels, thereby enhancing accessibility of the application when using different modalities. XForms user interface controls are generic and suited for device-independence. The high-level nature of the user interface controls, and the consequent intent-based authoring of the user interface makes it possible to re-target the user interaction to different devices. By defining XML-based declarative event handlers that cover common use cases, the majority of XForms documents can be statically analyzed, reducing the need for imperative scripts for event handlers. The optional id attribute of type xsd:ID assigns an identity to the containing element. Foreign attributes are allowed on all XForms elements. The src attribute assigns a URI to be automatically retrieved. Binding expression interpreted as XPath. This attribute has no meaning when a bind attribute is present. Optional XForms Model selector. Specifies the ID of an XForms Model to be associated with this binding element. This attribute has no meaning for the current binding element when a bind attribute is present. Rules for determining the context XForms Model are located at 7.4 Evaluation Context. Reference to a bind element. Binding expression interpreted as XPath. This attribute has no meaning when a bind attribute is present. Optional XForms Model selector. Specifies the ID of an XForms Model to be associated with this binding element. This attribute has no meaning for the current binding element when a bind attribute is present. Rules for determining the context XForms Model are located at 7.4 Evaluation Context. Reference to a bind element. Optional space-separated list of XPath extension functions (represented by QNames) required by this XForms Model. Guidance on the use of this attribute is at 7.12 Extension Functions. Optional list of xsd:anyURI links to XML Schema documents outside this model element. The XForms Processor must process all Schemas listed in this attribute. Within each XForms Model, there is a limit of one Schema per namespace declaration, including inline and linked Schemas.Note:The schema list may include URI fragments referring to elements located elsewhere in the containing document; e.g. "#myschema". Optional attribute with a default value of empty string and legal values defined by the datatype xforms:versionList.  Examples are "1.0" and "1.0 1.1". If one or more versions are indicated by this attribute on the default model, then an XForms Processor must support at least one of the listed language versions of XForms. Otherwise, the XForms Processor must terminate processing after dispatching the event xforms-version-exception to the default model.  If the XForms Processor supports more than one language version indicated by the version setting on the default model or if the version setting on the default model is empty string (whether specified or by default), then the XForms Processor may execute the XForms content using any language conformance level available to it.  If any non-default model has a version setting that is incompatible with the language version selected by the XForms Processor, or if any model contains an illegal version attribute value, then the XForms Processor must terminate processing after dispatching the event xforms-version-exception to the default model. The version attribute is optional to implement, but future versions of XForms are expected to support it, so implementation support is strongly encouraged. Optional link to externally defined initial instance data. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-link-exception Event). Optional reference to a bind element. When present, the binding reference on this attribute is used in preference to any binding reference from the ref attribute. Optional selector binding expression enabling submission of a portion of the instance data. The selected node, and all descendants, are selected for submission. The default value is "/". Required attribute specifying the protocol to be used to transmit the serialized instance data. There is no default value. Optional attribute specifying the version of XML to be serialized. Optional attribute specifying whether the serializer should add extra white space nodes for readability. Optional attribute specifying the mediatype for XML instance serialization. Authors should ensure that the type specified is compatible with application/xml.  Optional attribute specifying an encoding for serialization. Optional attribute specifying whether to omit the XML declaration on the serialized instance data. Optional attribute specifying whether to include a standalone declaration in the serialized XML. Optional attribute specifying element names to be serialized with CDATA sections. Optional attribute specifying how the information returned after submit should be applied. In the absence of this attribute, "all" is assumed. Optional attribute specifying the separator character between name/value pairs in urlencoding. The default value is ';'. Optional attribute providing control over namespace serialization. If absent, all namespace nodes present in the instance data are considered for serialization. If present, specifies list of namespace prefixes to consider for serialization, in addition to those visibly utilized. As in [Exc-C14N], the special value #default specifies the default namespace. An optional attribute containing  a model binding expression that selects the set of nodes on which this bind operates. version is defined as the string "1.0" for XForms 1.0. conformance-level strings are defined in 12 Conformance.  Optional attribute to define an appearance hint. if absent, the user agent may freely choose any suitable rendering. Optional attribute is a non-negative integer in the range of 0-32767 used to define the navigation sequence. This gives the author control over the sequence in which form controls are traversed. The default navigation order is specified in the chapter 4 Processing Model. Optional attribute defines a shortcut for moving the input focus directly to a particular form control. The value of this is a single character which when pressed together with a platform specific modifier key (e.g., the alt key) results in the focus being set to this form control.The user agent must provide a means of identifying the accesskeys that can be used in a presentation. This may be accomplished in different ways by different implementations, for example through direct interaction with the application or via the user's guide. The accesskey requested by the author might not be made available by the player (for example it may not exist on the device used, or it may be used by the player itself). Therefore the user agent should make the specified key available, but may map the accesskey to a different interaction behavior. Optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. when true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. when true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. when true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. This form control does not use the UI Common attribute group, but nevertheless still contains an optional appearance attribute, as defined above. Optional. An XPath expression to be evaluated. The string result of the evaluation is rendered by the form control. If binding attributes are present to select a node, this attribute has no effect. The evaluation context is the same as would be applied to the evaluation of the single node binding. This XPath expression is re-evaluated whenever there is a change in any node to which the expression refers. Optional. Space-separated list of suggested media types, used by the XForms Processor to determine the possible sources of data to upload.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is false. Optional hint for the lexical starting bound for the range&mdash;a legal value for the underlying data.

Required reference to a case element.  Optional 1-based initial value of the repeat index. The default value is 1. Optional hint to the XForms Processor as to how many elements from the collection to display.  Required XPath expression evaluated to determine insert location. Required selector ("before" or "after") of insert before/after behavior. Required XPath expression evaluated to determine delete location. Required reference to a repeating element. Required name of the event to dispatch. Required reference to the event target. Optional boolean indicating if this event bubbles&mdash;as defined in [DOM2 Events]. The default value  is true for a custom event. For predefined events, this attribute has no effect. Optional boolean indicating if this event is cancelable&mdash;as defined in [DOM2 Events]. The default value  is true for a custom event. For predefined events, this attribute has no effect. Required reference to a form control. Optional. Link to external resource to load, defined as an [XLink 1.0] link between this element and the remote resource indicated. No XLink actuate value is defined, since control of actuation is defined by XML Events. The XLink show value depends on the show attribute. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an error (4.5.3 The xforms-link-error Event). Optional link behavior specifier. if this attribute is missing, a default value of "replace" is assumed. The document is loaded into a new presentation context, e.g., a new window. Form processing in the original window continues. The document is loaded into the current window.

Fallside, 2001. W3C Recommendation available at: http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/. The user interface is not hard-coded to use radio buttons. Different devices (such as voice browsers) can render the concept of "select one" as appropriate. Form controls always have labels directly associated with them as child elements&mdash;this is a key feature designed to enhance accessibility. There is no need for an enclosing form element, as in HTML. (See 2.4 Multiple Forms per Document for details on how to author multiple forms per document) Markup for specifying form controls has been simplified in comparison with HTML forms. There is complete flexibility in the structure of the XML instance data, including the use of attributes. Notice that XML namespaces are used, and that a wrapper element of the author's choosing contains the instance data. Empty elements number and expiry serve as place-holders in the XML structure, and will be filled in with form data provided by the user. An initial value ("cc") for the form control is provided through the instance data, in this case an attribute method. In the submitted XML, this initial value will be replaced by the user input, if the user changes the form control displaying that data. Initialization Interaction Notification Error Conditions All XML Schemas  are  loaded. If an error occurs while attempting to access or process a remote document, processing halts with an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-link-exception Event). If an external source for the initial instance data is given, an XPath data model [7 XPath Expressions in XForms] is constructed from it; otherwise if inline initial instance data is given, that is used instead. If the external initial instance data is not well-formed XML or cannot be retrieved, processing halts with an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-link-exception Event). If neither are given, then default processing of this event ends because  the data model is not constructed in this phase, but during user interface construction (4.2.2 The xforms-model-construct-done Event).  If applicable, P3P initialized. [P3P 1.0] The binding expression is evaluated to ensure that it points to a node that exists. If this is not the case then the form control should behave in the same manner as if it had bound to a model item with the relevant model item property resolved to false. For the first reference to an instance a default instance is created by following the rules described below.A root instanceData element is created. An instance data element node will be created using the binding expression from the user interface control as the name. If the name is not a valid QName, processing halts with an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event).  For the second and subsequent references to an instance which was automatically created the following processing is performed:If a matching instance data node is found, the user interface control will be connected to that element. If a matching instance data node is not found, an instance data node will be created using the binding expression from the user interface control as the name. If the name is not a valid QName, processing halts with an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event).  Form controls that have a navindex specified and assign a positive value to it are navigated first.Outermost form controls are navigated in increasing order of the navindex value. Values need not be sequential nor must they begin with any particular value. Form controls that have identical navindex values are to be navigated in document order. Ancestor form controls (&lt;group&gt;, &lt;repeat&gt;, and &lt;switch&gt;) establish a local navigation sequence. All form controls within a local sequence are navigated, in increasing order of the navindex value, before any outside the local sequence are navigated. Form controls that have identical navindex values are navigated in document order.  Those form controls that do not specify navindex or supply a value of "0" are navigated next. These form controls are navigated in document order. Those form controls that are disabled, hidden, or not relevant are assigned a relative order in the overall sequence but do not participate as navigable controls.  The navigation sequence past the last form control (or before the first) is undefined. XForms Processors may cycle back to the first/last control, remove focus from the form, or other possibilities. All UI bindings should be reevaluated as necessary. its current value its validity whether it is required, readonly or relevant. the constraint model item property is true For each node in the selected XPath node-set, any child bind elements are recursively processed as described in the three points of this list. When the form control is interactively changed, and has the "incremental="true" setting, the event sequence described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change may be initiated at implementation dependent intervals. When the form control is interactively changed and does not have the "incremental=true" setting, no events are required to be dispatched, and thus no order is defined. When focus changes from the form control and the value has changed, the event sequence is as described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change. No event sequences are defined. When a selection is interactively changed, and the form control has the "incremental="true" setting, the event sequence is described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change, which may be followed immediately by the sequence described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change. When a selection is interactively changed, and the form control does not have the "incremental="true" setting, the event sequence is described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change. When focus changes from the form control and the value has changed, the event sequence is as described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change. Activating the form control causes the event sequence defined at 4.6.8 Sequence: Activating a Trigger. Activating the form control causes the event sequence defined at 4.6.8 Sequence: Activating a Trigger, followed immediately by the event sequence defined at 4.6.9 Sequence: Submission. xforms-deselect xforms-select xforms-recalculate xforms-revalidate [n] xforms-value-changed [n] xforms-valid or xforms-invalid [n] xforms-enabled or xforms-disabled [n] xforms-optional or xforms-required [n] xforms-readonly or xforms-readwrite [n] xforms-out-of-range or xforms-in-range Perform further deferred updates as necessary DOMActivate xforms-submit xforms-submit-done or xforms-submit-error Fixed properties are static values that the XForms Processor evaluates only once. Such properties consist of literals, and are not subject to XPath evaluation. Computed expressions are XPath expressions that provide a value to the XForms Processor. Such values are recalculated at certain times as specified by the XForms Processing Model (see 4 Processing Model). These expressions encode dynamic properties, often constraints, such as the dependency among various data items. Computed expressions are not restricted to examining the value of the instance data node to which they apply. XPath expressions provide the means to traverse the instance data; more complex computations may be encoded as call-outs to external scripts. If the bound instance data node is an element, the element must not have the xsi:nil attribute set to true.  The value of the bound instance data node must be convertible to an XPath string with a length greater than zero.   An XML Schema associated with the instance data. An XML Schema xsi:type attribute in the instance data. An XForms type constraint associated with the instance data node using XForms binding. If no type constraint is provided, the instance data node defaults to type="xsd:string" (default to string rule). No variable bindings are in place.   The available function library is defined below in 7.6 The XForms Function Library.   Any namespace declarations in scope for the attribute that defines the expression are applied to the expression.  The context node, position and size are determined according to rules described below. A binding element is "outermost" if the element has no ancestor binding elements. If an outermost binding element is contained by a model, then the context node for the outermost binding element is the top-level document element node of the default instance of the containing model element. Otherwise, the context node for outermost binding elements is the top-level document element node of the default instance in the default model.  For outermost binding elements, the context size and position are 1.  The context node, position and size for non-outermost binding elements is determined using  the binding expression attribute or in-scope evaluation context  of the  nearest ancestor binding element.  This is also referred to as "scoped resolution". For a non-outermost binding element:If the nearest ancestor binding element is not a bound element, then the in-scope evaluation context of the non-outermost binding element is equivalent to the in-scope evaluation context of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Single-Node binding, then the in-scope evaluation context of the non-outermost binding element has a context size and position of 1 and the context node is the one resulting from the Single-Node binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Node Set binding, then the XForms processor dynamically generates an occurrence of the non-outermost binding element for each of the nodes in the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element.  The dynamic in-scope evaluation context for each generated occurrence of the non-outermost binding element has a context size equal to the size of the nodeset identified by the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element, the context node is the node for which the occurrence of the non-outermost binding element was generated, and the position is equal to the position of the generator node in the nodeset identified by the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Node Set binding, then the non-outermost binding element has its own in-scope evaluation context separately from those of its dynamically generated occurences described above.  The in-scope evaluation context has a context position of 1, and the context node and size are set by the first node and the size of the nodeset identified by the Node Set binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. Once the context node of the in-scope evaluation context has been determined according to the rules above, if the binding element expresses a model attribute that refers to a model other than the one containing the context node, then the context node of the in-scope evaluation context is changed to be the top-level document element node of the default instance of the referenced model, and the context position and size are changed to 1. If a form control violates its data binding restriction, an xforms-binding-exception must occur. Form controls that write simpleContent to instance data must do so exactly as defined by the XForms Action 10.1.9 The setvalue Element Attribute nodes: returns the string-value of the node. Text nodes: returns the string-value of the node. Namespace, processing instruction, comment, and the XPath root node: behavior is undefined. Form controls must distinguish rendering between valid and invalid states. Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. Form controls must indicate when the bound instance data contains a value the form control is not capable of rendering. Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. Form controls must provide a default explanation for the above when no user-specified explanation is available. Form controls are considered to be non-relevant if any of the following apply:the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to empty nodeset, the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to a non-relevant instance node, the form control is contained by a non-relevant switch or group (which includes a non-relevant repeat item), or the form control is contained by a non-selected case element of a switch. On activation, if child element filename is present and a filename is available, upload places the filename of the data to upload in the instance at the node indicated by the binding attributes on child element filename. On activation, if child element mediatype is present and a mediatype is available, upload places the mediatype of the data to upload in the instance at the node indicated by the binding attributes on child element mediatype.  When bound to an instance data node of type xsd:base64binary, xsd:hexBinary, or a type derived by restriction thereof, on activation upload places the binary content in the content of the node with the indicated encoding. When bound to an instance data node of type xsd:anyURI (or a type derived by restriction thereof), on activation upload places a URI in the content of the node.For security reasons, the XForms Processor must not dereference the URI bound to this form control without explicit user permission.Note:Implementors note that upload must associate the binary content, mediatype, and filename with that URI for 11.4 Serialization as multipart/related and 11.5 Serialization as multipart/form-data serialization.  Implementations with a file system should support file upload&mdash;selecting a specific file. The types of files presented by default should reflect the mediatype specified by attribute mediatype, for example defaulting to only audio file types in the file dialog when the mediatype is "audio/*".  Implementations with specific pen/digitizer hardware should (and implementations with other pointing devices may) support scribble&mdash;allowing in-place creation of pen-based data.  Implementations with specific audio recording capabilities should support record audio&mdash;in-place recording of an audio clip.  Implementations with a digital camera, scanner interface or screen capture should support acquire image&mdash;in-place upload of images from an attached device.  Implementations with video recording capability should provide a record video option.  Implementations with 3d capabilities should provide a 3d interface option. Implementations may provide proprietary implementations (for example, a mediatype of text/rtf could invoke an edit window with a proprietary word processing application) Implementations are encouraged to support other input devices not mentioned here. Implementations which cannot support upload for the given mediatype must make this apparent to the user. Factoring all human readable messages to a separate resource XML file. Using URIs into this XML resource bundle within individual label elements Finally, an XForms implementation could use content negotiation to obtain the appropriate XML resource bundle, e.g., based on the accept-language headers from the client, to serve up the user interface with messages localized to the client's locale. the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to empty nodeset, the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to a non-relevant instance node, the group is contained by a non-relevant switch or group (which includes a non-relevant repeat item), or the group is contained by a non-selected case element of a switch. Dispatches an xforms-deselect event to the currently selected case  in the switch containing the identified case. Adjusts the selected states (not the attribute values) on the affected cases to reflect the new state of the switch containing the identified case. Dispatches an xform-select event to the case just selected. The target node, selected by the binding attributes on the list form control, must be an element node, otherwise an exception results (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). The element node associated with the item, selected by the binding attributes on copy, is deep copied as a child of the target node. A full computational dependency rebuild is done. The target node, selected by the binding attributes on the list form control, must be an element node, otherwise an exception results (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). The child element node associated with the item, selected by the binding attributes on copy, is deleted. A full computational dependency rebuild. The homogeneous collection to be updated is determined by evaluating the Node Set Binding. if the collection is empty, the insert action has no effect. The node-set binding identifies a homogeneous collection in the instance data. The final member of this collection is cloned to produce the node that will be inserted. Finally, this newly created node is inserted into the instance data at the location specified by attributes position and at. Attribute at is evaluated to determine the insertion index &ndash; a numerical value that is the index into the node-set. The attribute at is evaluated with the first node in document order from the node set binding as the context node, the size of the node set binding as the context size and 1 as the context position. Attribute position specifies whether the new node is inserted before or after this index.The rules for selecting the index are as follows:The return value of the XPath expression in attribute at is processed according to the rules of the XPath function round(). For example, the literal 1.5 becomes 2, and the literal 'string' becomes NaN. If the result is NaN, the insert appends to the end of the node-set. If the resulting index is outside the valid range of the node-set, it is replaced with either 1 or the size of the node-set, whichever is closer. The index for any repeating sequence that is bound to the homogeneous collection where the node was added is updated to point to the newly added node. The indexes for inner nested repeat collections are re-initialized to startindex. If the insert is successful, the event xforms-insert is dispatched. The homogeneous collection to be updated is determined by evaluating the Node Set Binding. If the collection is empty, the delete action has no effect. The n-th element node is deleted from the instance data, where n represents the number returned from node-set index evaluation, defined in 9.3.5 The insert Element. If no nth node exists, the operation has no effect.  The index should point to the same node after a delete as it did before the delete except:When the last remaining item in the collection is removed, the index position becomes 0. When the index was pointing to the deleted node, which was the last item in the collection, the index will point to the new last node of the collection and the index of inner repeats is reinitialized. When the index was pointing to the deleted node, which was not the last item in the collection, the index position is not changed and the index of inner repeats is re-initialized. If the delete is successful, the event xforms-delete is dispatched. The Node Set Binding is evaluated to locate the homogeneous collection to be operated on by this repeat.  The index for this repeating structure is initialized to the value of startindex. if the initial startindex is less than 1 it defaults to 1. If the index is greater than the initial node-set then it defaults to the size of the node-set.  User interface as specified by the repeat is generated for the requisite number of members of the collection as specified by attributes on element repeat.  Predefined XForms events (i.e., xforms-event-name), in which case the bubbles and cancelable attributes are ignored and the standard semantics as defined in 4 Processing Model apply. An event created by the XForms author with no predefined XForms semantics and as such not handled by default by the XForms Processor. Element nodes: If the element has any child text nodes, the first text node is replaced with one corresponding to the new value. If no child text nodes are present, a text node is created, corresponding to the new value, and appended as the first child node. Attribute nodes: The string-value of the attribute is replaced with a string corresponding to the new value. Text nodes: The text node is replaced with a new one corresponding to the new value. Namespace, processing instruction, comment, and the XPath root node: behavior is undefined. Selected instance data is serialized according to the rules stated at 11.2 Submission Options. Serialized instance data is submitted using the protocol indicated by the rules stated at 11.2 Submission Options. The response returned from the submission is applied as follows: For a success response including a body, when the value of the replace attribute on element submission is "all", the event xforms-submit-done is dispatched, and submit processing concludes with entire containing document being replaced with the returned body. For a success response including a body of a non-XML media type (i.e. with a content type not matching any of the specifiers in [RFC 3023]), when the value of the replace attribute on element submission is "instance", nothing in the document is replaced and submit processing concludes after dispatching xforms-submit-error. For a success response including a body, when the value of the replace attribute on element submission is "none", submit processing concludes after dispatching xforms-submit-done. For a success response not including a body, submit processing concludes after dispatching xforms-submit-done. Behaviors of other possible values for attribute replace are not defined in this specification. For an error response nothing in the document is replaced, and submit processing concludes after dispatching xforms-submit-error. action (xsd:anyURI) method (xsd:string, enumerated below) An XML document is produced following the rules of the XML output method defined in [XSLT 1.0] section 16 and 16.1, using the values supplied as attributes of the submission element.Handling of namespace nodes: The default behavior is that every namespace node is serialized according to the rules of the XML output method, so that at least one namespace declaration appears in the serialized XML for each in-scope namespace. Additional inherited namespaces are declared on the root element of the serialized XML. If, however, attribute includenamespaceprefixes on element submission is present, then all namespace declarations not visibly utilized in the instance data (as defined in [Exc-C14N]) and the default namespace if it is empty are excluded from the root element serialization, unless the corresponding namespace prefix is listed in the includenamespaceprefixes attribute. The special value #default represents the default namespace.  Mediatype: By default, the mediatype of the serialized XML instance is application/xml, but can be changed to a compatible type using element submission attribute mediatype. Authors should ensure that the type specified is compatible with application/xml. multipart/related message header requirements:Must contain a type parameter of the mediatype of the serialized XML instance. Must contain a start parameter referring to the Content-ID first body part (root). First body part (root) requirements:Must have Content-Type parameter of the type specified by the submission mediatype attribute. Content is serialized by the rules at 11.3 Serialization as application/xml. Subsequent part requirements:One part for each node with a datatype of xsd:anyURI populated by upload with:A Content-Type header that represents the type of the attachment if known, otherwise application/octet-stream. A Content-Transfer-Encoding header. A Content-ID header whose value matches the URI in the associated instance data node. The binary content associated with the URI, serialized according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding heading. Each element node is visited in document order. Each element that has exactly one text node child is selected for inclusion. Element nodes selected for inclusion are as encoded as Content-Disposition: form-data MIME parts as defined in [RFC 2387], with the name parameter being the element local name. Element nodes of any datatype populated by upload are serialized as the specified content and additionally have a Content-Disposition filename parameter, if available. The Content-Type must be text/plain except for xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary, and derived types, in which case the header represents the media type of the attachment if known, otherwise application/octet-stream. If a character set is applicable, the Content-Type may have a charset parameter. Each element node is visited in document order. Each element that has one text node child is selected for inclusion. Note that attribute information is not preserved. Element nodes selected for inclusion are encoded as EltName=value, where = is a literal character, EltName represents the element local name, and value represents the contents of the text node. The separator character {sep} from the separator attribute on submission is used between pairs of encoded name/value pairs, e.g. EltName1=value1{sep}EltName2=value2{sep}EltName3=value3. Note that contextual path information is not preserved, nor are namespaces or namespace prefixes. As a result, different elements might serialize to the same name.The encoding of EltName and value are as follows: space characters are replaced by +, and then non-ASCII and reserved characters (as defined by [RFC 2396] as amended by subsequent documents in the IETF track) are escaped by replacing the character with one or more octets of the UTF-8 representation of the character, with each octet in turn replaced by %HH, where HH represents the uppercase hexadecimal notation for the octet value and % is a literal character. Line breaks are represented as "CR LF" pairs (i.e., %0D%0A).  All such encodings are concatenated, maintaining document order. The submit URI from the action attribute is examined. If it does not already contain a ? (question mark) character, one is appended. If it does already contain a question mark character, then a separator character from the attribute separator is appended. The serialized form data is appended to the URI. [XML 1.0] [XML Names] [XML Events] [XPath 1.0] Implementing all features. [XML Schema part 2] [XML 1.0] [XML Names] [XML Events] [XML Schema part 2] A master dependency directed graph is created as detailed in D.1 Details on Creating the Master Dependency Directed Graph. To provide consistent behavior, implementations must reduce the number of vertices to be processed by computing a pertinent dependency subgraph consisting only of vertices and edges that are reachable from nodes that require recomputation. This is detailed in D.2 Details on Creating the Pertinent Dependency Subgraph. Note that on a first recomputation (such as on form load), the pertinent dependency subgraph will be the same as the master dependency directed graph. A topological sort is performed on the vertices of the pertinent dependency subgraph, resulting in an order of evaluation in which each vertex is evaluated only after those vertices on which it depends and before all vertices which depend on it. The topological sort algorithm is discussed at [Algorithms]. The recalculate process completes. A vertex with inDegree of 0 is selected for evaluation and removed from the pertinent dependency subgraph. In the case where more than one vertex has inDegree zero, no particular ordering is specified. If the pertinent dependency subgraph contains vertices, but none have an inDegree of 0, then the calculation structure of the form has a loop, and an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-compute-exception Event) must be thrown, terminating processing. If the vertex corresponds to a computed item, computed expressions are evaluated as follows:calculate: If the value of the model item changes, the corresponding instance data is updated and the dirty flag is set. relevant, readOnly, required, constraint: If any or all of these computed properties change, the new settings are immediately placed into effect for associated form controls. For each vertex in the depList of the removed vertex, decrement the inDegree by 1. If no vertices remain in the pertinent dependency subgraph, then the calculation has successfully completed. Otherwise, repeat this sequence from step 1. The set of allowable characters specified in a pattern may be so wide that it is not possible to deduce a reasonable input mode setting. Nevertheless, there frequently is a kind of characters that will be input by the user with high probability. In such a case, inputmode allows to set the input mode for the user's convenience. In some cases, it would be possible to derive the input mode setting from the pattern because the set of characters allowed in the pattern closely corresponds to a set of characters covered by an inputmode attribute value. However, such a derivation would require a lot of data and calculations on the user agent. Small devices may leave the checking of patterns to the server, but will easily be able to switch to those input modes that they support. Being able to make data entry for the user easier is of particular importance on small devices. Applied published errata. Updated document status, change log, acknowledgements, and production notes.

A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. Forms are an important part of the Web, and they continue to be the primary means for enabling interactive Web applications. Web applications and electronic commerce solutions have sparked the demand for better Web forms with richer interactions. XForms is the response to this demand, and provides a new platform-independent markup language for online interaction between a person (through an XForms Processor) and another, usually remote, agent. XForms are the successor to HTML forms, and benefit from the lessons learned from HTML forms.  Further background information on XForms can be found at http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms.  This specification has been written with various types of readers in mind&mdash;in particular XForms authors and XForms implementors. We hope the specification will provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient, attractive and accessible documents without overexposing them to the XForms implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all they need to build conforming XForms Processors. The specification begins with a general presentation of XForms before specifying the technical details of the various XForms components.  The specification has been written with various modes of presentation in mind. In case of a discrepancy, the online electronic version is considered the authoritative version of the document.  The specification is organized into the following chapters:  An introduction to XForms. The introduction outlines the design principles and includes a brief tutorial on XForms.  XForms reference manual. The bulk of the reference manual consists of the specification of XForms. This reference defines XForms and how XForms Processors must interpret the various components in order to claim conformance.  Appendixes contain an XML Schema description of XForms, references, examples, and other useful information.  Throughout this document, the following namespace prefixes and corresponding namespace identifiers are used:  xforms: The XForms namespace, e.g. http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms (see 3.1 Namespace for XForms)html: An XHTML namespace,  e.g. http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml (see [XHTML 1.0])xs: The XML Schema namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema (see [XML Schema part 1])xsd: The XML Schema namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema (see [XML Schema part 2])xsi: The XML Schema for instances namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance (see [XML Schema part 1])ev: The XML Events namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events (see [XML Events])my: Any user defined namespace This is only a convention; any namespace prefix may be used in practice.  The following typographical conventions are used to present technical material in this document.  The XML representations of various elements within XForms are presented using the syntax for Abstract Modules in XHTML Modularization [XHTML Modularization]. Examples are set off typographically: References to external documents appear as follows: [Sample Reference] with links to the references section of this document.  The following typesetting convention is used for additional commentary:  A gentle explanation to readers.   A specific issue for which input from implementors is requested, for example as part of the Candidate Recommendation phase.  None recorded. This informative section provides an overview of the new features and changed behaviors available in XForms 1.1. The model element now must support a version attribute to help authors bridge the transition between XForms 1.0 to XForms 1.1. The submission element offers many new features that allow significantly improved data communications capabilities for XForms, including: Access to SOAP-based web services, RESTful services, ATOM-based services, and non-XML services Improved control over submission processing and serialization Ability to control the submission URI and headers with instance data Targetted instance data replacement capabilities Finally, over a dozen new examples have been added to illustrate submission usage. XForms 1.1 now offers email and card-number datatypes so form authors can easily validate email address and credit card number input values. XForms 1.1 now contains many new functions that can be used in calculate and other XPath expressions to enable numerous features, including: working with tabular data and parallel lists: current(), choose() and context()  basic security capabilities: digest(), hmac(), and random() improved numeric and string processing: power(), is-card-number(), and compare() search across instances of a model: two parameter id() function access to context information added to many XForms events: event() The behavioral description common to all form controls has been improved to indicate default layout styling and rendering requirements for required data. The output form control has been improved to render non-text mediatypes, particularly images, obtained from instance data. The ability to create wizard-like interfaces with dynamically available form controls has been improved.  Details are in the description of improvements to actions. XForms has been designed on the basis of several years' experience with HTML forms. HTML forms have formed the backbone of the e-commerce revolution, and having shown their worth, have also indicated numerous ways they could be improved. The primary difference when comparing XForms with HTML forms, apart from XForms being in XML, is the separation of the data being collected from the markup of the controls collecting the individual values. By doing this, it not only makes XForms more tractable by making it clear what is being submitted where, it also eases reuse of forms, since the underlying essential part of a Form is no longer irretrievably bound to the page it is used in. A second major difference is that XForms, while designed to be integrated into XHTML, is no longer restricted only to be a part of that language, but may be integrated into any suitable markup language. XForms has striven to improve authoring, reuse, internationalization, accessibility, usability, and device independence. Here is a summary of the primary benefits of using XForms: Submitted data is strongly typed and can be checked using off-the-shelf tools. This speeds up form filling since it reduces the need for round trips to the server for validation. This obviates the need for custom server-side logic to marshal the submitted data to the application back-end. The received XML instance document can be directly validated and processed by the application back-end. This obviates duplication, and ensures that updating the validation rules as a result of a change in the underlying business logic does not require re-authoring validation constraints within the XForms application. This enables the XForms author to go beyond the basic set of constraints available from the back-end. Providing such additional constraints as part of the XForms Model enhances the overall usability of the resulting Web application. Using XML 1.0 for instance data ensures that the submitted data is internationalization ready. XForms separates content and presentation. User interface controls encapsulate all relevant metadata such as labels, thereby enhancing accessibility of the application when using different modalities. XForms user interface controls are generic and suited for device-independence. The high-level nature of the user interface controls, and the consequent intent-based authoring of the user interface makes it possible to re-target the user interaction to different devices. By defining XML-based declarative event handlers that cover common use cases, the majority of XForms documents can be statically analyzed, reducing the need for imperative scripts for event handlers. In the XForms approach, forms are comprised of a section that describes what the form does, called the XForms Model, and another section that describes how the form is to be presented.  Consider a simple electronic commerce form that might be rendered as follows: It is clear that we are collecting a value that represents whether cash or a credit card is being used, and if a credit card, its number and expiration date. This can be represented in the XForms model element, which in XHTML would typically be contained within the head section:  This simply says that we are collecting three pieces of information (note that we have as yet not said anything about their types), and that they will be submitted using the URL in the action attribute. XForms defines a device-neutral, platform-independent set of form controls suitable for general-purpose use. The controls are bound to the XForms Model via the XForms binding mechanism, in this simple case using the ref attribute on the controls. In XHTML, this markup would typically appear within the body section (note that we have intentionally defaulted the XForms namespace prefix here): Notice the following features of this design: The user interface is not hard-coded to use radio buttons. Different devices (such as voice browsers) can render the concept of "select one" as appropriate. Core form controls always have labels directly associated with them as child elements&mdash; this is a key feature designed to enhance accessibility. There is no need for an enclosing form element, as in HTML. (See 2.4 Multiple Forms per Document for details on how to author multiple forms per document) Markup for specifying form controls has been simplified in comparison with HTML forms.  The fact that you can bind form controls to the model like this simplifies integrating XForms into other host languages, since any form control markup may be used to bind to the model. The XForms Processor can directly submit the data collected as XML. In the example, the submitted data would look like this: XForms processing keeps track of the state of the partially filled form through this instance data. Initial values for the instance data may be provided or left empty as in the example. Element instance essentially holds a skeleton XML document that gets updated as the user fills out the form. It gives the author full control on the structure of the submitted XML data, including namespace information. When the form is submitted, the instance data is serialized as an XML document. Here is an alternative version of the earlier example: In this case the submitted data would look like this: This design has features worth calling out: There is complete flexibility in the structure of the XML instance data, including the use of attributes. Notice that XML namespaces are used, and that a wrapper element of the author's choosing contains the instance data. Empty elements number and expiry serve as place-holders in the XML structure, and will be filled in with form data provided by the user. An initial value ("cc") for the form control is provided through the instance data, in this case an attribute method. In the submitted XML, this initial value will be replaced by the user input, if the user changes the form control displaying that data. To connect this instance data with form controls, the ref attributes on the form controls need to be changed to point to the proper part of the instance data, using binding expressions: Binding expressions are based on XPath [XPath 1.0], including the use of the @ character to refer to attributes, as seen here. Note that for illustrative purposes, the first two expressions make use of the XPath context node, which defaults to the top-level element (here my:payment). The third expression shows an absolute path. XForms allows data to be checked for validity as the form is being filled. In the absence of specific information about the types of values being collected, all values are returned as strings, but it is possible to assign types to values in the instance data. In this example, number should accept digits only, and should have between 14 and 18 digits and expiry should accept only valid month/date combinations. Furthermore, the credit card information form controls for number and expiry are only relevant if the "cc" option is chosen for method, but are required in that case. By specifying an additional component, model item properties, authors can include rich declarative validation information in forms. Such information can be taken from XML Schemas as well as XForms-specific additions, such as relevant. Such properties appear on bind elements, while Schema constraints are expressed in an XML Schema fragment, either inline or external. For example:  In the above example, the relevant expression uses absolute XPath notation (beginning with /) because the evaluation context nodes for computed expressions are determined by the binding expression (see 7.2 Evaluation Context), and so any relative node path in the first bind relevant above would be relative to /my:payment/my:number XForms processing places no limits on the number of individual forms that can be placed in a single containing document. When a single document contains multiple forms, each form needs a separate model element, each with an id attribute so that they can be referenced from elsewhere in the containing document. In addition, form controls should specify which model element contains the instance data to which they bind. This is accomplished through a model attribute that is part of the binding attributes. If no model attribute is specified on the binding element, the nearest ancestor binding element's model attribute is used, and failing that, the first XForms Model in document order is used. This technique is called 'scoped resolution', and is used frequently in XForms. The next example adds an opinion poll to our electronic commerce form. Additionally, the following markup would appear in the body section of the document: The main difference here is the use of model="poll", which identifies the instance. Note that submit refers to the submission element by ID and does not require binding attributes.  More XForms examples can be found in H Complete XForms Examples. XForms is an application of XML [XML 1.0] and has been designed for use within other XML vocabularies&mdash;in particular within a future version of XHTML [XHTML 1.0]. XForms always requires such a host language. This chapter discusses the structure of XForms that allow XForms to be used with other document types. The namespace URI for XForms is http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms. The XForms schema has the target namespace specified and as such is compatible with the XForms 1.0 definition.  The Common Attribute Collection applies to every element in the XForms namespace. Foreign attributes are allowed on all XForms elements. The author-optional id attribute of type xsd:ID assigns an identity to the containing element. Elements can be identified using any attribute of type ID (such as xml:id), not just the id attribute defined above. Section 3.3.2 The instance Element defines attribute src for the instance element.  Binding expression interpreted as XPath. This attribute has no meaning when a bind attribute is present. Author-optional XForms Model selector. Specifies the ID of an XForms Model to be associated with this binding element. This attribute has no meaning for the current binding element when a bind attribute is present. Rules for determining the context XForms Model are located at 7.2 Evaluation Context. Author-optional  reference to a bind element. In this specification, when an XForms element is declared to have a Single-Node Binding, then the author must specify the  Single-Node Binding  unless the element explicitly states that it is author-optional.  In some cases, an XForms element may allow a Single-Node Binding, but one or more attributes in the Single-Node Binding attribute group are inappropriate for that XForms element.  In such cases, the exact attributes are listed for the XForms element, but those attributes still express a Single-Node Binding if they appear in the element.  For example, the submission element forbids the model attribute because the model is defined to be the one containing the submission, so the attributes ref and bind are listed for submission rather than referring to the Single-Node Binding attribute group, but if a ref or bind attribute is used on a submission, it does express a Single-Node Binding.  First-node rule: When a Single-Node Binding attribute selects a node-set of size &gt; 1, the first node in the node-set, based on document order, is used. It is an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event) if the XForms Processor encounters a model  attribute  IDREF value that refers to an ID not on a model element, or a bind  attribute  IDREF value that refers to an ID not on a bind element. Binding expression interpreted as XPath. This attribute has no meaning when a bind attribute is present. Author-optional reference to a bind element. In some cases, an XForms element may allow a Node-Set Binding, but one or more attributes in the Node-Set Binding attribute group are inappropriate for that XForms element.  In such cases, the exact attributes are listed for the XForms element, but those attributes still express a Node-Set Binding if they appear in the element.  For example, the bind element only allows the nodeset attribute.  The model and bind attributes are not allowed on a bind element, but if the nodeset attribute appears on a bind element, it does express a Node-Set Binding.  It is an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event) if the XForms Processor encounters a model  attribute  IDREF value that refers to an ID not on a model element, or a bind  attribute  IDREF value that refers to an ID not on a bind element. This collection contains one attribute for each model item property, with an attribute name exactly matching the name of the model item property, as defined in 6.1 Model Item Property Definitions. The XForms Core Module defines the major structural elements of XForms, intended for inclusion in a containing document. The elements and attributes included in this module are: Commonref (binding-expression)bind (xsd:IDREF)resource (xsd:anyURI)action (xsd:anyURI) [deprecated]mode ("asynchronous"|"synchronous")method ("post"|"get"|"put"|"delete"|"multipart-post"|"form-data-post"|"urlencoded-post"|Any other NCName|QNameButNotNCName)validate (xsd:boolean)relevant (xsd:boolean)serialization ("application/xml"|"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"|"multipart/related"|"multipart/form-data"|"none")version (xsd:NMTOKEN)indent (xsd:boolean)mediatype (xsd:string)encoding (xsd:string)omit-xml-declaration (xsd:boolean)standalone (xsd:boolean)cdata-section-elements (QNameList)replace ("all"|"instance"|"text"|"none" | QNameButNotNCName)instance (xsd:IDREF)targetref (nodeset XPath Expression)separator (';' | '&amp;')includenamespaceprefixes (xsd:NMTOKENS) Elements defined in the XForms Actions module, when that module is included, are also allowed in the content model of model and submission, as shown above. Within the containing document, these structural elements are typically not rendered. The XForms Processor must ignore any foreign-namespaced attributes that are unrecognized.  Note that the presence of foreign namespaced elements is subject to the definition of the containing or compound document profile. Common Attributes: Common Special Attributes: Author-optional space-separated list of XPath extension functions (represented by QNames) required by this XForms Model. Guidance on the use of this attribute is at 7.12 Extension Functions. Examples: Since the version attribute is not specified on the model, the XForms Processor may choose any language conformance level, which may be incompatible with the version setting of the second model.  Therefore,  the message action occurs during initialization of the second model due to its version  incompatibility with the default model. Since the version attribute is not specified on the second model, it is compatible with any choice made based on the version setting on the default model. This author-optional element contains or references initial instance data. Common Attributes: Common Special Attributes: Author-optional link to externally defined initial instance data. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-link-exception Event). Author-optional link to externally defined initial instance data. If the link is traversed and the traversal fails, it is treated as an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-link-exception Event). If the src attribute is given, then it takes precedence over inline content and the resource attribute, and the XML data for the instance is obtained from the link.  If the src attribute is omitted, then the data for the instance is obtained from inline content if it is given or the resource attribute otherwise.  If both the resource attribute and inline content are provided, the inline content takes precedence.  If the initial instance data is given by a link (from src or resource), then the instance data is formed by creating an XPath data model of the linked resource. If the link cannot be traversed, then processing halts after dispatching an xforms-link-exception with a resource-uri of the link that failed. If the initial instance data is given by inline content, then instance data is obtained by first creating a detached copy of the inline content (including namespaces inherited from the enveloping ancestors), then creating an XPath data model over the detached copy. The detached copy must consist of content that would be well-formed XML if it existed in a separate document. Note that this restricts the element content of instance to a single child element. All data relevant to the XPath data model must be preserved during processing and  as input to  submission serialization, including processing instructions, comment nodes and all whitespace. XForms authors who need additional control over the serialization of namespace nodes can use the includenamespaceprefixes attribute on the submission element. Details about the submission element and its processing are described in 11 The XForms Submission Module. Common Attributes: Common, Model Item Properties (author-optional) Special Attributes: See 6 Model Item Properties for details on model item properties. See 7.2 Evaluation Context for details on how the evaluation context is determined for each attribute of the bind element. There are many different ways a host language might include XForms. One approach uses only well-formed processing, disregarding validation. Another case uses strict validation, for example XHTML 1.0, in which only predefined elements are allowed. Another common approach is to allow unregulated content in a few select places. A host language that chooses this option can use the Extension module. Author-optional element extension is a container for application-specific extension elements from any namespace other than the XForms namespace. This specification does not define the processing of this element. Common Attributes: Common For example, RDF metadata could be attached to an individual form control as follows: This section is deleted. This chapter defines the XForms Processing Model declaratively by enumerating the various states attained by an XForms Processor and the possible state transitions that exist in each of these states. The chapter enumerates the pre-conditions and post-conditions that must be satisfied in each of these states. XForms Processors may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end results are identical to that described in this chapter. State transitions are in general initiated by sending events to parts of the XForms tree. The XForms Processing Model consists of events in the following categories: Initialization Interaction Notification Error Conditions XForms processing is defined in terms of events, event handlers, and event responses. XForms uses the events system defined in [DOM2 Events][XML Events], with an event capture phase, arrival of the event at its Target, and finally the event bubbling phase. This section defines the various stages of the initialization phase. The processor begins initialization by dispatching an event xforms-model-construct to each XForms Model in the containing document. How the XForms Processor itself is requested to initialize is implementation dependent. Dispatched to each XForms model by the XForms processor. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: All XML Schemas are loaded. If an error occurs while attempting to access or process a remote document, processing halts with an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-link-exception Event). If applicable, P3P initialization occurs. [P3P 1.0] After all XForms Models have been initialized, an xforms-model-construct-done event is dispatched to each model element. Dispatched after the completion of xforms-model-construct processing. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event happens once, no matter how many XForms Models are present in the containing document, and results in the following, for each form control: Processing can proceed in one of two different ways depending on whether an instance in a model exists when the first form control is processed. If the instance referenced on the form control existed when the first form control was processed:  The single node  binding expression is evaluated, if it exists on the form control,  to ensure that it points to a node that exists. If this is not the case then the form control should behave in the same manner as if it had bound to a model item with the relevant model item property resolved to false. Otherwise, the user interface for the form control is created and initialized. If the instance referenced on the form control did not exist when the first form control for the same instance was processed:  For the first reference to an instance a default instance is created by following the rules described below. A root instanceData element is created. An instance data element node will be created using the binding expression from the user interface control as the name. If the name is not a valid QName, processing halts with an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event).  For the second and subsequent references to an instance which was automatically created the following processing is performed: If a matching instance data node is found, the user interface control will be connected to that element. If a matching instance data node is not found, an instance data node will be created using the binding expression from the user interface control as the name. If the name is not a valid QName, processing halts with an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event).  The above steps comprise the default processing of xforms-model-construct-done. After all form controls have been initialized and all xforms-model-construct-done events have been processed, an xforms-ready event is dispatched to each model element. Dispatched as part of xforms-model-construct-done processing. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. Dispatched by the processor to advise of imminent shutdown of the XForms Processor, which can occur from user action, or from the load XForms Action, or as a result of form submission. Target: model Bubbles: No Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. Dispatched in response to: a request to rebuild the internal data structures that track computational dependencies within a particular XForms Model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: All model item properties are initialized by processing all bind elements in document order. For each bind: For each node in the selected XPath node-set, any child bind elements are recursively processed as described in the three points of this list. Dispatched in response to: a request to recalculate all calculations associated with a particular XForms Model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: C Recalculation Sequence Algorithm describes one possible method for achieving the required recalculation behavior. Dispatched in response to: a request to revalidate a particular XForms Model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None the constraint model item property is true the value is non-empty if the required model item property is true xsi:type attributes on instance data elements are processed even in the absence of external or inline schema. The applicable XML schema definitions are determined as defined in Section 3.3.1 The model Element. The default action for this event results in the following: Dispatched in response to: a request to update all form controls associated with a particular XForms Model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: All UI Expressions  are   reevaluated  (implementations may optimize this operation but must behave as if all UI Expressions are reevaluated). current values (for the appropriate form controls and related UI elements) validity the proper number of and content for repeat objects. Dispatched in response to: a user request to reset the model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: The instance data is reset to the tree structure and values it had immediately after having processed the xforms-ready event. Then, the events xforms-rebuild, xforms-recalculate, xforms-revalidate and xforms-refresh are dispatched to the model element in sequence. Dispatched in response to: user request to navigate to the next or previous Core Form Control. Target: Core Form Controls Bubbles: No Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for these events results in the following: Navigation according to the default navigation order. For example, on a keyboard interface, "tab" might generate an xforms-next event, while "shift+tab" might generate an xforms-previous event.  Navigation is determined on a containing document-wide basis. The host language is responsible for defining overall navigation order. The following describes a possible technique based on a navindex attribute, using individual form controls as a navigation unit: The &lt;group&gt;, &lt;repeat&gt;, and &lt;switch&gt; structures serve as container  navigation units that, instead of providing a single navigation point,  create a local navigation context for child form controls (and possibly other substructures). The navigation sequence is determined as follows: Form controls that have a navindex specified and assign a positive value to it are navigated first. Outermost form controls are navigated in increasing order of the navindex value. Values need not be sequential nor must they begin with any particular value. Form controls that have identical navindex values are to be navigated in document order. Ancestor form controls (&lt;group&gt;, &lt;repeat&gt;, and &lt;switch&gt;) establish a local navigation sequence. All form controls within a local sequence are navigated, in increasing order of the navindex value, before any outside the local sequence are navigated. Form controls that have identical navindex values are navigated in document order.  Those form controls that do not specify navindex or supply a value of "0" are navigated next. These form controls are navigated in document order. Those form controls that are disabled, hidden, or not relevant are assigned a relative order in the overall sequence but do not participate as navigable controls.

Error indications happen as a result of unusual conditions in the XForms Processor. Some of these are "fatal" errors, which halt processing, and bear the suffix "exception". Others are simply for notification, and bear the suffix "error". For all events in this section, it is permissible for the XForms Processor to perform some kind of default handling, for example logging error messages to a file. Dispatched as an indication of: an illegal binding expression, or a model attribute that fails to point to the ID of a model element, or a bind attribute that fails to point to the ID of a bind element, or a submission attribute that fails to point to the ID of a submission element, or an instance attribute on the submission element that fails to point to an instance element in the same model element as the submission.

When the form control is interactively changed, and has the incremental="true" setting, the event sequence described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change may be initiated at implementation dependent intervals. When the form control is interactively changed and does not have the incremental="true" setting, no events are required to be dispatched, and thus no order is defined. When the user activates the control and the value has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node, the event sequence consists of the events described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change followed by dispatching the DOMActivate event.  See 8.1.2 The input Element for an example. When focus changes from the form control and the value has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node,  the event sequence is as described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change. The implementation of an output dispatches xforms-output-error if it unable to process the output data (such as corrupt image data when the output mediatype indicates it is image data).  This event may occur each time the output is given new data (such as a change of data in the bound data node or a change of the bound data node). When a selection is interactively changed, and the select or select1 form control has the incremental="false" setting, the event sequence is described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change. When the user activates the control and the selection has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node, the event sequence consists of the events described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change followed by dispatching the DOMActivate event.  Note that this event sequence will have been preceded by the event sequence described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change at the moment the selection was changed. When focus changes from the form control and the selection has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node,   the event sequence is as described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change.  Note that this event sequence will have been preceded by the event sequence described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change at the moment the selection was changed. Activating the form control causes the event sequence defined at 4.6.8 Sequence: Activating a Trigger. Activating the form control causes the event sequence defined at 4.6.8 Sequence: Activating a Trigger, followed immediately by the event sequence defined at 4.6.9 Sequence: Submission. xforms-deselect (for each item deselected by the change, if any) xforms-select (for each item selected by the change, if any) xforms-recalculate xforms-revalidate [n] xforms-value-changed [n] xforms-valid or xforms-invalid [n] xforms-enabled or xforms-disabled [n] xforms-optional or xforms-required [n] xforms-readonly or xforms-readwrite [n] xforms-out-of-range or xforms-in-range (The order in which these events are dispatched is not defined). Perform further deferred updates as necessary DOMActivate xforms-submit xforms-submit-serialize xforms-submit-done or xforms-submit-error  For each model element, the XForms Processor maintains the state in an internal structure called instance data that conforms to the XPath Data Model [XPath 1.0]. XForms Processors that implement DOM must provide DOM access to this instance data via the interface defined below.  Instance data always has a single root element, and thus corresponds to a DOM Document.  The IDL for this interface follows: If the instance-id parameter is the empty string, then the document element of the default instance is returned.  Otherwise,  this method returns a DOM Document that corresponds to the instance data associated with the instance element containing an ID matching the instance-id parameter. If there is no matching instance data, a DOMException is thrown.  This method signals the XForms Processor to rebuild any internal data structures used to track computational dependencies within this XForms Model. This method takes no parameters and raises no exceptions.  This method signals the XForms Processor to perform a full recalculation of this XForms Model. This method takes no parameters and raises no exceptions.  This method signals the XForms Processor to perform a full revalidation of this XForms Model. This method takes no parameters and raises no exceptions.  This method signals the XForms Processor to perform a full refresh of form controls bound to instance nodes within this XForms Model. This method takes no parameters and raises no exceptions.  For this version of the XForms specification, the feature string for the [DOM2 Core] DOMImplementation interface hasFeature method call is "org.w3c.xforms.dom" and the version string is "1.0".  This chapter defines the datatypes used in defining an XForms Model. XForms supports all XML Schema  1.0  datatypes except for xsd:duration, xsd:ENTITY, xsd:ENTITIES, and xsd:NOTATION. Concepts value space, lexical space and constraining facets are as specified in [XML Schema part 2].  XForms Processors must treat these datatypes  as in-scope without requiring the inclusion of an XML Schema. The built-in datatype xsd:duration is not supported, except as an abstract datatype. Instead, either xforms:dayTimeDuration or xforms:yearMonthDuration should be used. XForms defines the following types in the XForms namespace. These datatypes can be used in the type model item property without a namespace prefix when the default namespace is the XForms namespace. All of these datatypes allow empty content. XForms Processors must treat these datatypes as in-scope without requiring the inclusion of an XML Schema.  Many default XML schema types report empty content as invalid, which conflicts with the use of the required model item property.  The following XForms datatypes are defined as having a lexical space consisting of either the empty string or the lexical space of  the corresponding XML schema datatype. Although some XML schema datatypes do allow empty string content,   they have also  been added to the available XForms datatypes for form authoring consistency.  Built-in primitive types (in the XForms namespace): dateTimetimedategYearMonthgYeargMonthDaygDaygMonthstringbooleanbase64BinaryhexBinaryfloatdecimaldoubleanyURIQName Built-in derived types (in the XForms namespace): normalizedStringtokenlanguageNameNCNameIDIDREFIDREFSNMTOKENNMTOKENSintegernonPositiveIntegernegativeIntegerlongintshortbytenonNegativeIntegerunsignedLongunsignedIntunsignedShortunsignedBytepositiveInteger This datatype serves as a base for the listItems datatype. The lexical space for listItem permits one or more characters valid for xsd:string, except white space characters.  In most cases, it is better to use markup to distinguish items in a list. See 9.3.6 The itemset Element. The dayTimeDuration datatype is made available by the XForms processor based on the following lexical space definition: The yearMonthDuration datatype is made available by the XForms processor based on the following lexical space definition: Examples of valid xforms:email addresses editors@example.com~my_mail+{nospam}$?@sub-domain.example.info Examples of invalid xforms:email addresses editors@(this is a comment)example.infoeditors{at}example{dot}infomailto:editors@example.com It is outside the scope of XForms to determine whether a given email address actually corresponds to an active mailbox. The email datatype is made available by the XForms processor based on the following lexical space definition: The display representation of this datatype by form controls is not required to match the lexical space of the bound instance data. User agents should apply appropriate conventions to the display and input of values, including separator characters. The standard defines the structure of the number as well as how to apply the Luhn formula to ensure a correct check digit. This type only specifies the format of the number.  The complementary XPath function is-card-number() should be used to validate that the ID number conforms to the specification. This chapter defines infoset contributions that can be bound to instance data nodes with element bind (see 3.3.4 The bind Element). The combination of these contributions to an instance data node is called a model item. Taken together, these contributions are called model item properties, and are defined in the following section. In contrast, the term Schema constraint refers only to XML Schema constraints from the facets of a given datatype. Model item properties can be distinguished along various axes. Computed expressions vs. fixed properties: Fixed properties are static values that the XForms Processor evaluates only once. Such properties consist of literals, and are not subject to XPath evaluation. Computed expressions are XPath expressions that provide a value to the XForms Processor. Such values are recalculated at certain times as specified by the XForms Processing Model (see 4 Processing Model). These expressions encode dynamic properties, often constraints, such as the dependency among various data items. Computed expressions are not restricted to examining the value of the instance data node to which they apply. XPath expressions provide the means to traverse the instance data; more complex computations may be encoded as call-outs to external scripts. Inheritance rules: Some model item properties define inheritance rules, in which case the XForms Processor needs to keep track of two separate values: 1) the local value, which is applied from an attribute of element bind, and 2) the inherited value, which is determined by combining the evaluated local value with the evaluated values from ancestor nodes in the instance data. The sample recalculation algorithm defined in C Recalculation Sequence Algorithm is defined to operate only on the local values of a model item property. It assumes that an implementation propagates the combined values to a node's descendants. Assigning local values: Local values are assigned by processing all bind elements in an XForms Model in document order. It is an error to attempt to set a model item property twice on the same node (see 4.3.1 The xforms-rebuild Event for details)..  The following sections list the model item properties available as part of all model items. For each, the following information is provided: DescriptionComputed Expression (yes or no)Legal ValuesDefault ValueInheritance Rules Computed Expression: No. Default Value: xsd:string. Inheritance Rules: does not inherit. This model item property contributes to the overall validity assessment of a node; the effect of validity state on bound form controls is described in Section 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls. The first bind expresses the default datatype of xsd:string. Description: describes whether the node content is restricted from changing.  Computed Expression: Yes.  Legal Values: Any expression that is convertible to XPath boolean with boolean().  Default Value: false(), unless a calculate  is specified for the value property, then true().  Inheritance Rules: If any ancestor node evaluates to true, this value is treated as true. Otherwise, the local value is used. This is the equivalent of taking the logical OR of the evaluated readonly property on the local and every ancestor node. When  true, this model item property indicates that the XForms Processor  must not allow any direct changes to the content of the  bound instance data node  from constructs other than the model item property system (i.e. other than a calculate). Instance mutations performed by submission, form controls, DOM interface access, and XForms actions must not insert or copy a new node into a parent node that is readonly, delete or replace a node whose parent is readonly, nor change the value or content of a readonly node.  A node that is readonly but whose parent is not readonly can be entirely deleted or replaced by a submission even though doing so indirectly results in deletion or replacement of readonly descendant nodes. In addition to restricting value changes, the readonly model item property provides information to the XForms user interface  about how bound form controls should be rendered. Form controls bound to instance data with the readonly model item property  that evaluates to true  should indicate that entering or changing the value is not allowed. This specification does not define any effect of the readonly model item property  on visibility, focus, or navigation order.  Here, we have associated a readonly property with an element. The following example illustrates the ability to override the default readonly setting on calculated nodes. The calculate on my:data is executed on any recalculate that follows a rebuild, including the form initialization, so the user initially sees the word 'default'. The user may make any change to my:data with the input, and the calculation will be executed again as a result.  Therefore, if the user enters an empty value, then the calculate will change my:data back to 'default'. Description: describes whether a value is required before the instance data is submitted. Computed Expression: Yes. Legal Values: Any expression that is convertible to XPath boolean with boolean().  Default Value: false().  Inheritance Rules: does not inherit. A form may require certain values, and this requirement may be dynamic. When evaluating to true, this model item property indicates that a non-empty instance data node is required before a submission of instance data can occur. Non-empty is defined as: The value of the bound instance data node must be convertible to an XPath string with a length greater than zero.  The XML Schema feature represented by nillable and xsi:nil is unrelated to the XForms required model item property.  An element may have the xsi:nil attribute set to true to indicate that its empty content is schema valid, but if the required model item property for that element node is true, then the element violates the required constraint because a required node must be non-empty as defined above. Here, we have associated a required property with element my:last-name to indicate that a value must be supplied. XML Schema has a similarly named concept with use="required|optional|prohibited". This is different than the XForms Model item property, in two ways: 1) use applies only to attributes, while XForms required applies to any node. 2) use is concerned with whether the entire attribute must be specified (without regard to value), while required determines whether a value is required of the node before submission.  Description: indicates whether the model item is currently relevant. Instance data nodes with this property evaluating to false are unavailable in the user interface and can be removed from submission serialization. Computed Expression: Yes. Legal Values: Any expression that is convertible to XPath boolean with boolean(). Default Value: true(). Inheritance Rules: If any ancestor node evaluates to XPath false, this value is treated as false. Otherwise, the local value is used. This is the equivalent of taking the logical AND of the evaluated relevant property on the local and every ancestor node. Many forms have data entry sections that depend on other conditions. For example, a form might ask whether the respondent owns a car. It is only appropriate to ask for further information about their car if they have indicated that they own one. Through single node UI bindings,  the relevant model item property provides information to the XForms user interface regarding visibility, focus, and navigation order. In general, when true, associated form controls should be made available for user interaction. When false, associated form controls (and any children) and group and switch elements (including content) must be made unavailable, removed from the navigation order, and not allowed focus. Typically, non-relevant user interface  content is not presented, or it may be styled as disabled. Elements other than form controls may also use a single node binding that selects a non-relevant node, but such elements are not made unavailable or non-operable due to the single node binding because it is not a UI binding expression.  For example, actions such as 10.2 The setvalue Element and 10.16 The message Element or the 11.1 The submission Element remain operable if their single node bindings select a non-relevant node.  However, some such elements may indirectly be affected by the relevant model item property.  For example, it is possible for non-relevant nodes to be excluded from the data of a submission.  Similarly, non-relevance indirectly affects the running of actions because a non-relevant form control disables event handlers that listen for events targeted at the form control element.  A core  form control, group or switch must express a single node binding in order to be associated with an instance node. Due to the definition of repeat object, the relevant model item property of the node in the associated repeat item affects the availability of the repeat object. Here, we have associated a relevant property with element my:discount to indicate a discount is relevant when the order amount is greater than 1000. Description: supplies an expression used to calculate  a string value for  the associated instance data node. Computed Expression: Yes. Legal Values: Any XPath expression. Default Value: none. Inheritance Rules: does not inherit. An XForms Model may include model items whose string values are computed from other values. For example, the sum over line items for quantity times unit price, or the amount of tax to be paid on an order.  The formula for  such a computed value can be expressed with a calculate property, whose XPath expression is evaluated, converted to a string with the XPath string() function, and stored as the value content of the calculated data node. Chapter 4 Processing Model contains details of when and how the calculation is performed. Here, we have associated a relevant property with element my:discount to indicate a discount of 10% is relevant when the order amount is greater than 1000. Description: specifies a predicate that needs to be satisfied for the associated instance data node to be considered valid. Computed Expression: Yes. Legal Values: Any expression that is convertible to XPath boolean with boolean(). Default Value: true(). Inheritance Rules: does not inherit.  When evaluating to XPath false, the associated model item is not valid; the converse is not necessarily true. This model item property does not prevent form controls and XForms actions from setting invalid values into data nodes. Chapter 4 Processing Model contains details of when and how the constraint is calculated as well as when validation is performed. This model item property contributes to the overall validity assessment of a node; the effect of validity state on bound form controls is described in Section 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls. Here, a constraint property associated with element my:to indicates that its value must be greater than that of element my:from. Specifying minimum and maximum occurrences for nodes in the instance data can be achieved by using the count() function within a constraint property. Description: Attaches a P3P data element to an instance data node, indicating the specific kind of data collected there. Computed Expression: No. Legal Values: xsd:string. Default Value: none Inheritance Rules: does not inherit. This model item property holds a description of the kind of data collected by the associated instance data node, based on the P3P datatype system [P3P 1.0]. This information may be used to enhance the form-fill experience, for example by supplying previously-known data.  Here, we have attached both XML Schema and P3P type information to element first-name via element bind. Chapter 5 Datatypes described how XForms uses the XML Schema datatype system to constrain the value space of data values collected by an XForms Model. Such datatype constraints can be provided via an XML Schema. Alternatively, this section lists various mechanisms for attaching type constraints to instance data. Attributes xsi:schemaLocation and xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation are ignored for purposes for locating a Schema. The XForms Processing Model applies XML Schema facets as part of the validation process. At the simplest level, it is necessary to associate a set of facets (through an XML Schema datatype) with a model item. This has the effect of restricting the allowable values of the associated instance data node to valid representations of the lexical space of the datatype.  The set of facets associated with a model item must be determined by the following list, as if it were processed in the given order. When multiple datatype restrictions apply to the same model item, the combination of all given restrictions must apply. Note that it is possible to produce a combination of restrictions that is impossible to satisfy; authors are encouraged to avoid this practice. Applicable XML schema definitions (including those associated an external or an inline schema, or by xsi:type) An XForms type constraint associated with the instance data node using XForms binding. If no type constraint is provided, the instance data node defaults to type="xsd:string" (default to string rule). The following declares a datatype based on xsd:string with an additional constraining facet. This new datatype would then be associated with one or more model items through one of the methods outlined here. This defines element first-name to be of type my:nonEmptyString.   Here, we have attached type information to element first-name via element bind. Thus the XForms author can extend external schemas without having the ability to change them.  XForms uses XPath to address instance data nodes in binding expressions, to express constraints, and to specify calculations. XPath expressions in XForms are based on [XPath 1.0]. A future version of XForms is expected to enable use of  [XPath 2.0].  At the time of evaluation, an XPath expression must be syntactically correct. In addition, the namespaces the expression references must be in scope and the functions and variables it references must be defined. If any of these conditions is not satisfied, an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event) is raised, except for binding expressions, which produce a different exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). XPath datatypes are used only in binding expressions and computed expressions. XForms uses XPath datatypes boolean, string, number, and node-set. Additionally, the type object is used to denote a parameter or return value that can be any one of the four XPath datatypes.  A future version of XForms is expected to use XPath 2.0, which includes support for XML Schema datatypes.  Within XForms, the default model is the first model in document order.  The default instance of any model is the first child instance in document order within that model.  XPath expressions appearing in various XForms attributes are used to reference  instance data.  Every XPath expression requires an evaluation context consisting of a node, position, size, variable bindings, function set, and namespace context.  For all evaluation contexts in XForms, No variable bindings are in place.   The available function library is defined below in 7.5 The XForms Function Library.   Any namespace declarations in scope for the attribute that defines the expression are applied to the expression.  The context node, position and size are determined according to rules described below. A binding element is any element that is explicitly allowed to have a binding expression attribute, and a bound element is any element that explicitly declares a binding expression attribute. A binding expression attribute contains an XPath expression that references zero or more nodes of instance data.  Every XPath expression requires an evaluation context. The in-scope evaluation context of a binding element provides an evaluation context for the binding expression attribute.  The following rules are used in determining the node, position and size of the in-scope evaluation context:  A binding element is "outermost" if the element has no ancestor binding elements. If an outermost binding element is contained by a model, then the context node for the outermost binding element is the top-level document element node of the default instance of the containing model element. Otherwise, the context node for outermost binding elements is the top-level document element node of the default instance in the default model.  For outermost binding elements, the context size and position are 1.  The context node, position and size for non-outermost binding elements is determined using  the binding expression attribute or in-scope evaluation context  of the  nearest ancestor binding element.  This is also referred to as "scoped resolution". For a non-outermost binding element: If the nearest ancestor binding element is not a bound element, then the in-scope evaluation context of the non-outermost binding element is equivalent to the in-scope evaluation context of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Single-Node binding, then the in-scope evaluation context of the non-outermost binding element has a context size and position of 1 and the context node is the one resulting from the Single-Node binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Node Set binding, then the XForms processor dynamically generates an occurrence of the non-outermost binding element for each of the nodes in the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element.  The dynamic in-scope evaluation context for each generated occurrence of the non-outermost binding element has a context size equal to the size of the nodeset identified by the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element, the context node is the node for which the occurrence of the non-outermost binding element was generated, and the position is equal to the position of the generator node in the nodeset identified by the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Node Set binding, then the non-outermost binding element has its own in-scope evaluation context separately from those of its dynamically generated occurences described above.  The in-scope evaluation context has a context position of 1, and the context node and size are set by the first node and the size of the nodeset identified by the Node Set binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. Once the context node of the in-scope evaluation context has been determined according to the rules above, if the binding element expresses a model attribute that refers to a model other than the one containing the context node, then the context node of the in-scope evaluation context is changed to be the top-level document element node of the default instance of the referenced model, and the context position and size are changed to 1. The in-scope evaluation context of an element that is not a binding element is the same as if the element were a binding element. For example, the in-scope evaluation context for the setindex action element is required to provide the context for evaluating the index attribute, so it is determined as if the element could contain a binding expression attribute. XPath expressions also appear in model item property attributes of the bind element to define computed expressions.  If the bind element does not express a Node Set binding, then the in-scope evaluation context for model item property attributes of the bind is equal to the in-scope evaluation context for the bind.  Otherwise, the bind has a Node Set binding, and computed expressions for each model item property attribute are generated for each node.  For each computed expression generated, the evaluation context node, position and size are determined by the same method as dynamic in-scope evaluation context rule above, except the computed expression is used in lieu of a binding expression attribute such that the bind element is the nearest ancestor binding element. XPath expressions also appear in the special attributes of several other XForms elements, such as the value attribute on setvalue and output, the at attribute of insert and delete, or the index attribute of setindex.  Generally, if the containing element does not express a Single Node Binding or Node Set Binding, then the special attribute is evaluated using the in-scope evaluation context.  Special attributes may be evaluated using the in-scope evaluation context even if the containing element expresses a Single Node Binding or Node Set Binding.  However, for some special attributes, the evaluation context node, position and size are based on the result of the Single Node Binding or Node set Binding.  Each special attribute that contains an XPath expression describes how its evaluation context node, position and size are determined.  In the following example, the group has a binding expression of level2/level3. According to the rules above, this outermost element node would have a context node of /level1, which is the  document element node of the instance data. The select1 form control then inherits a context node from the parent group.  This section describes how the in-scope evaluation context of an element is determined, not whether the in-scope evaluation will be used.  The Single-Node Binding or Node Set Binding of a non-outermost binding element is not evaluated if the in-scope evaluation context does not contain a context node.  This can occur if the Single-Node Binding or Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor bound element produces an empty nodeset.  Also, if the Single-Node Binding or Node Set Binding of an element is expressed with the bind attribute, then the resulting node or nodeset is obtained from the referenced bind element.  The nodeset attribute of a bind element is evaluated using the in-scope evaluation of the bind element, not the in-scope evaluation context of an element that references it with a bind attribute. Given the following default instance: and the following XPath expression: Finally, note that an XPath expression can reference many nodes even if its final result is an empty nodeset. Defining a reference in terms of matching a NodeTest was a deliberate design decision that creates more references than necessary in order to make the computation system more responsive to certain types of changes without needing a rebuild operation. When a leaf node is filtered from an expression by a predicate, the leaf node is still considered to be referenced so that if the condition changes such that the leaf node would be included in the result value of the expression, then the expression will be recalculated without needing a rebuild.  However, once a node is rejected from an expression, further location steps are not evaluated relative to the rejected node, so references for that location step are only created based on its execution relative to accepted nodes.  For example, if the above expression were in a calculate, and if the attribute of either b element changes to the value X, the expression would be recalculated but it still does not record a reference to any c elements until the references are obtained in the next rebuild operation. Moreover, the excess references created by the definition may cause some recalculation constructs to cease operation due to circular references that would not be created with a stricter definition of a reference. A future version of XForms may use a stricter version of referencing for recalculation and a less strict definition of referencing for the purpose of detecting and performing automatic rebuild operations. The referencing of a repeat index by the index() function is handled as a special case.  Implementations must behave as if each occurrence of a repeat is associated with an implicitly managed instance data node containing the repeat index.  If a repeat identified as R1 contains a repeat identified as R2, then a repeat index instance node is managed for each occurrence of R2 that is generated by R1.  An invocation of the function index() in an XPath expression is considered to reference the repeat index instance node corresponding to the repeat index value that it returns. The computational dependency data structure described in Section 4.3.2 The xforms-recalculate Event essentially stores the dependency lists of instance nodes corresponding to all the references made by computed expressions (see Appendix C Recalculation Sequence Algorithm for details).  The computational dependency data structure is not reconstructed in response to a dynamic dependency change.  Instead, the form author may request a rebuild of the computational dependency data structures using the rebuild action.  Additionally, the insert and delete actions set a rebuild flag so that computational dependency data structures will be rebuild at the end of an action sequence. Due to the rebuild flag setting on insert and delete, a form author can use many kinds of dynamic dependencies in model binding expressions and computed expressions without ever explicitly invoking the rebuild action.  This includes the use of functions such as position(), last(), and count() on element and attribute nodes because the return values of the functions in these cases is fixed except when an insert or delete occurs.  By comparison, functions such as id(), instance(), and index() can establish dynamic dependencies that can necessitate invoking a rebuild if they are used in model binding expressions or computed expressions because the results of the functions are affected by changing the values of instance nodes, not by inserting or deleting nodes.  There are several different categories of XPath expressions used in XForms, and they are processed at different times depending on the category.   A binding expression is an XPath  expression used to bind a model item property to one or more instance nodes, or to bind a form control to instance data, or to specify the node or node set for operation by an action.  The evaluation schedule for binding expressions differs based on whether the binding expression is a model binding expression, UI binding expression, or a binding expression for an XForms action.  XPath expressions are also used in various other attributes of XForms binds, actions, form controls, and submissions, and their descendant elements.  These expressions follow one of the three schedules associated with binding expressions as described below.  A model binding expression is a kind of binding expression that can be used to declare model item properties, and is used in the Node-Set binding of the bind element. A computed expression is an XPath expression used to determine the value of a model item property based on instance data.  Several of the attributes of bind are computed expressions, including calculate, readonly, relevant, and required. Dynamic dependencies in model binding expressions and computed expressions will  require manual rebuilding of dependencies. If the index() function is being invoked from a model binding expression or computed expression, it will be necessary to invoke rebuild manually.  If the repeat index change occurs due to an implicit behavior such as a change to the focused form control, then the rebuild (along with recalculate, revalidate and refresh) can be invoked from a handler for DOMFocusIn attached to the repeat or each repeat object. Binding expressions on XForms actions and XPath expressions appearing in other attributes of XForms actions are evaluated at the time the XForms action is performed. In some cases, XForms actions have child elements that allow the values of some of their attributes to be determined based on instance data.  In these cases, the value attribute of the child element is evaluated at the time the corresponding attribute is needed in the processing model of the containing XForms action. Similarly, XPath expressions used in the attributes of submission and its child elements (other than XForms actions) are evaluated as needed within the submission processing model. Form authors can use dynamic dependencies in the XPath expressions of XForms Actions and Submissions without invoking any special data structure reconstruction actions because implementations must behave as if these expressions are evaluated as needed. Form authors can use dynamic dependencies in UI Expressions without invoking any special data structure reconstruction actions because the state of the user interface at the end of processing xforms-refresh is required to reflect the instance data as if all UI Expressions had been re-evaluated. Implementations may record UI Expression dependency lists on instance nodes to help streamline detection of the need to re-evaluate a UI Expression at the beginning of processing for xforms-refresh.  Such implementations may determine that a UI Expression is stale (needs re-evaluation) when a node on which it depends has been changed.  An implementation may also indicate that all UI Expressions are stale if a node of instance data is inserted, deleted or replaced, or the implementation may streamline detection of which UI Expressions may be affected by the insertion, deletion or replacement of an instance data node.  The XForms binding mechanism allows other XML vocabularies to make single node bindings between custom user interface controls and XForms instance data. As an example, XForms binding attribute bind might be used within XHTML 1.x user interface controls as shown below. See 3.2.3 Single-Node Binding Attributes.  Consider the following document with the one-and-only XForms model:  The following examples show three ways of binding user interface control xforms:input to instance element firstName declared in the model shown above.   The XForms Function Library includes the entire [XPath 1.0] Core Function Library, including operations on node-sets, strings, numbers, and booleans.  The function library provided by an XForms processor may also contain other extension functions as described in 7.12 Extension Functions. If an error occurs in an XPath function, then an  4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event or 4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event occurs..  boolean boolean-from-string(string) boolean is-card-number(string?) If the string parameter conforms to the pattern restriction of the card-number datatype, then this function applies the Luhn  algorithm described in [Luhn Patent] and returns true if the number satisfies the formula.  Otherwise, false is returned. If the parameter is omitted, it defaults to the string-value of the current context node. Examples (see also 5.2.7 xforms:card-number): returns true if and only if the context node contains a string that contains of zero or more digits and satisfies the formula. returns true. Other examples of string constants that will return true are : 5431111111111111, 341111111111111 and 6011601160116611. returns false. number avg(node-set) number min(node-set)  Function min returns the minimum value of the result of converting the string-values of each node in argument node-set to a number. "Minimum" is determined with the &lt; operator. If the parameter is an empty node-set, or if any of the nodes evaluate to NaN, the return value is NaN.  number max(node-set)  Function max returns the maximum value of the result of converting the string-values of each node in argument node-set to a number. "Maximum" is determined with the &lt; operator. If the parameter is an empty node-set, or if any of the nodes evaluate to NaN, the return value is NaN.  number count-non-empty(node-set)  Function count-non-empty returns the number of non-empty nodes in argument node-set. A node is considered non-empty if it is convertible into a string with a greater-than zero length.  number index(string) number power(number, number) Examples: returns 8 returns NaN. number random(boolean?) Example: could return 0.14159265358979 number compare(string, string) This function returns -1, 0, or 1, depending on whether the value of the first argument is respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the value of second argument based on lexicographic comparison using Unicode code point values [Unicode Collation Algorithm].  Example: returns -1 string if(boolean, string, string) Function if evaluates the first parameter as boolean, returning the second parameter when true, otherwise the third parameter.  This function is deprecated because a future version of XForms is expected to be based on [XPath 2.0], which contains an if construct that is incompatible with this function.Form authors and design tools are encouraged to use the function choose() from Section 7.11.1 The choose() Function instead of this function.  string property(string) This function accepts a string identifying a property name.  If the property name is not recognized, empty string is returned.  The property definitions for this function are as follows:  Examples: returns 1.1 may return full string digest(string, string, string?) returns a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d. returns 900150983cd24fb0d6963f7d28e17f72. returns ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad string hmac(string, string, string, string?) The following table presents the keywords for the third string parameter and the corresponding hash algorithms: returns effcdf6ae5eb2fa2d27416d5f184df9c259a7c79 returns 750c783e6ab0b503eaa86e310a5db738 returns 5bdcc146bf60754e6a042426089575c75a003f089d2739839dec58b964ec3843 string local-date() Example: could return 2006-10-13-07:00 could return 2006-10-13 returns a date that is 31 days from today. For example, if local-date() returns 2006-10-13-07:00, then the result is 2006-11-13. string local-dateTime() Example: could return 2006-10-13T16:04:17-07:00 string now()  returns 2006-10-14T01:04:17Z if local-dateTime() returns 2006-10-13T18:04:17-07:00 number days-from-date(string) This function returns a whole number of days, according to the following rules:  Examples: returns 11688 returns 11688 returns -1 string days-to-date(number) This function returns a string containing a lexical xsd:date that corresponds to the number of days passed as the parameter according to the following rules:  Examples: returns 2002-01-01 returns 1969-12-31 number seconds-from-dateTime(string) This function returns a possibly fractional number of seconds, according to the following rules:  Example: returns 0 returns 28800 string seconds-to-dateTime(number) Examples: returns 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z returns 1970-01-01T08:00:00Z string adjust-dateTime-to-timezone(string) Examples: returns 2007-10-07T02:22:00-07:00 in the Pacific time zone since daylight savings time applies. returns 2007-10-02T14:26:43-07:00 in the Pacific time zone since daylight savings time applies. number seconds(string) This function returns a possibly fractional number of seconds, according to the following rules:  Examples:  returns 297001.5  (3 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes, and 1.5 seconds) returns 0  because the year and month parts of the duration are ignored and the remaining portions are unspecified and default to 0 returns NaN  because the parameter is not a lexically valid duration number months(string) This function returns a whole number of months, according to the following rules:  Examples:  Examples:  returns 14  (1 year and 2 months)  returns -19  because the duration is negative and expresses 0 years and 19 months  node-set instance(string?) Example: For instance data corresponding to this XML:  The following expression selects the firstName node. Note that the instance function returns an element node, effectively replacing the leftmost location step from the path:  node-set current() Returns the context node used to initialize the evaluation of the containing XPath expression. Examples: For the following instance data: and the following value calculation bind: For the following instance data: and the following repeat structure: the output should contain Jan Feb Mar. node-set id(object, node-set?) Example: Returns nodes identified by X or Y from the instance data document associated with the root element of  the instance identified by Z. node-set context() This function returns the in-scope evaluation context node of the nearest ancestor element of the node containing the XPath expression that invokes this function.  The nearest ancestor element may have been created dynamically as part of the run-time expansion of repeated content as described in Section 4.7 Resolving ID References in XForms. Example: This action sets node x to the value of node y, where both nodes are children of the in-scope evaluation context node for the setvalue element. An intended use of this function is in conjunction with the repeat element (Section 9.3.1 The repeat Element and the setvalue action element (Section 10.2 The setvalue Element).  The intent is to provide form authors with a means of expressing a value attribute that is relative to the repeat context node when the Single Node Binding result is not. object choose(boolean, object, object) All parameters of an XPath function are evaluated, so the parameter that is not returned by this function is still evaluated, and its result is discarded by this function. Form authors and design tools are encouraged to use this function instead of the function if() described in Section 7.8.1 The if() Function, which has been deprecated.  Because this function returns an object instead of a string, migrating from if() to choose() may occasionally require conversion of the return result using the string() function. Example: Returns the node-set of matching x if it is non-empty and the node-set matching y otherwise. If the context node of the function contains attribute x, then the nodeset containing that attribute is returned.  Otherwise, the number 0 is returned. object event(string) The event context properties available for each event are provided in the sections that describe the events. Examples: If called from an xforms-insert event handler, a nodeset is returned containing the instance data node or nodes inserted. XForms documents may use additional XPath extension functions beyond those described here. A number of useful community extensions are defined at [EXSLT]. The names of any such extension functions must be declared in attribute functions on element model. Such declarations are used by the XForms Processor to check against available extension functions. XForms Processors perform this check at the time the document is loaded, and halt processing by signaling an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event) if the XForms document declares an extension function for which the processor does not have an implementation.   Explicitly declaring extension functions enables XForms Processors to detect the use of unimplemented extension functions at document load-time, rather than throwing a fatal exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event or 4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event) during user interaction. Failure by authors to declare extension functions will result in an XForms Processor potentially halting processing during user interaction with a fatal error.  Unless bound to form controls, instance data nodes are not presented to the user; consequently, there is no need for a form control corresponding to HTML input type="hidden".  The following table summarizes additional support elements for form controls. See also: 9.3.6 The itemset Element  (for selection controls) and 9.3.7 The copy Element (for selection controls). The following attributes are common to many user-interface related XForms elements, here called the UI Common attribute group. Author-optional attribute to define an appearance hint. If absent, the user agent may freely choose any suitable rendering. A host language is expected to add attributes such as xml:lang as well as an attribute, named class, that holds a list of strings that can be matched by CSS class selectors. Further, a host language must provide a way to indicate overall navigation order among form controls and other elements included in the host language, as well as keyboard or direct access navigation to specific elements. One such proposal is to uses a pair of attributes named navindex and accesskey, defined as follows: This author-optional attribute is a non-negative integer in the range of 0-32767 used to define the navigation sequence. This gives the author control over the sequence in which form controls are traversed. The default navigation order is specified in the chapter 4 Processing Model. This author-optional attribute defines a shortcut for moving the input focus directly to a particular form control. The value of this is a single character which when pressed together with a platform specific modifier key (e.g., the alt key) results in the focus being set to this form control. The user agent must provide a means of identifying the accesskeys that can be used in a presentation. This may be accomplished in different ways by different implementations, for example through direct interaction with the application or via the user's guide. The accesskey requested by the author might not be made available by the player (for example it may not exist on the device used, or it may be used by the player itself). Therefore the user agent should make the specified key available, but may map the accesskey to a different interaction behavior. Additionally, this module defines the following content sets: As shown above, the XML Events module adds the Actions content set into the UI Common content set. A host language may add markup to the UI Content set. When the XForms Extension module is present, it too should be included in the UI Common content set. XForms user interface controls are bound to the underlying instance data using binding attributes as defined in the chapter 6 Model Item Properties. Form controls enable accessibility by taking a uniform approach to such features as labels, help text, navigation, and keyboard shortcuts. Internationalization issues are addressed by following the same design principles as in XHTML. All form controls are suitable for styling as aural or visual media. Form controls encapsulate high-level semantics without sacrificing the ability to deliver real implementations. For instance, the form control select enables the user to select items from a set. These form controls distinguish the functional aspects of the underlying control from the presentational and behavioral aspects. This separation enables the expression of the intent underlying a particular form control&mdash;see [AUI97] for a definition of such high-level user interaction primitives.  Form controls when rendered display the underlying data values to which they are bound. While the data presented to the user through a form control must directly correspond to the bound instance data, the display representation is not required to match the lexical  space  value  of the bound instance data. For example, user agents should apply appropriate conventions to the display of dates, times, durations and numeric values including separator characters. All form controls must meet the following implementation requirements: All form controls, including container form controls, should have an inline layout by default (e.g. for a host language that supports CSS, the default styling should be display:inline).  By default, repeat items should have a block layout (e.g. a default styling of display:block for host languages that support CSS). If a form control violates its data binding restriction, an xforms-binding-exception must occur. Form controls that read or write simpleContent produce this exception whenever and as soon as they are bound to an element node that has an element child node. Form controls that write simpleContent to instance data must do so exactly as defined by the XForms Action setvalue (10.2 The setvalue Element). If a form control binds to an element node, then regardless of how many child nodes the element has, the result of the form control writing to the bound element node is that it has either a single non-empty text node child, or no children if the simpleContent written is the empty string (which is in accord with the data model of [XPath 1.0]). All form controls that read simpleContent instance data must do so as follows: Attribute nodes: returns the string-value of the node. Text nodes: returns the string-value of the node. Namespace, processing instruction, and comment nodes: behavior is undefined (implementation-dependent). the XPath root node: an xforms-binding-exception occurs. the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to empty nodeset, the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to a non-relevant instance node, the form control is contained by a non-relevant switch or group (which includes a non-relevant repeat item), or the form control is contained by a non-selected case element of a switch. Except as noted, relevant form controls must distinguish rendering between being bound to a required node versus a non-required node. Exceptions are form controls that do not directly render the string value of the bound node (including trigger and the container form controls).  Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. Relevant  form controls must distinguish rendering between valid and invalid states. Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. Relevant  form controls must indicate when the bound instance data contains a value or content that  the form control is not capable of rendering. Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. If a form control binds to a readonly node, then the form control must not allow the user to modify the node value.  The relevant form control that is bound to a readonly node  should render in a way which indicates that entering or changing the value is not allowed. Control of the render behavior should be made available to stylesheets.  Sections in this chapter define the various form controls by specifying the following: DescriptionCommon AttributesSpecial AttributesExamplesData Binding RestrictionsImplementation Requirements Description: This form control enables free-form data entry  or a user interface component appropriate to the datatype of the bound node.. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent (except xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary or any datatype derived from these). This control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Implementation Requirements: Must allow entry of a lexical value for the bound datatype. Implementations should provide a convenient means for entry of datatypes and take into account localization and internationalization issues such as representation of numbers. For example, an input bound to an instance data node of type xsd:date might provide a calendar control to enter dates; similarly, an input control bound to of type boolean might be rendered as a checkbox. Examples:  In the above, the class attribute can be used by a style sheet to specify the display size of the form control. Note that the constraints on how much text can be input are obtained from the underlying XForms Model definition and not from these display properties. A graphical browser might render the above example as follows:    A graphical browser might render the above example as follows:    The user can type a date into the text edit box, or press the button to open a calendar:    A graphical browser on a desktop device might activate form controls such as input in response to a special user action such as pressing the Enter key or either clicking or double-clicking with the mouse (depending on the type of form control). Description: This form control is used to provide the user with the ability to supply information to the system in a manner that makes it difficult for someone, other than the user, who may be observing the process to discern the value that is being supplied. A common use is for password entry. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent (except xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary or any datatype derived from these). This control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Implementation Requirements: Implementations, including accessibility aids, must obscure the value being entered into this form control. One possible approach would be to render a "*" or similar character instead of the actual characters entered. Note that this provides only a casual level of security; truly sensitive information will require additional security measures outside the scope of XForms. Example: A graphical browser might render this form control as follows:   Description: This form control enables free-form data entry and is intended for use in entering multiline content, e.g., the body of an email message. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent (except xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary or any datatype derived from these). This control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Implementation Requirements: Must allow entry of a lexical value for the bound datatype, including multiple lines of text.  Example:  In the above, the class attribute can be used by a style sheet to specify the display size of the form control. Note that the constraints on how much text can be input are obtained from the underlying XForms Model definition and not from these display properties. A graphical browser might render the above example as follows:    Description: This form control renders content based in part on instance data, but it provides no means for entering or changing data.   Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: This form control does not use the UI Common attribute group, but nevertheless still contains an author-optional appearance attribute, as defined above. Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent. This control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Element output can be used to display the value  of a particular instance node  by using a Single-Node Binding; it can also be used to display the result of evaluating an XPath expression by specifying the XPath expression to be evaluated via attribute value. Note that the Single-Node Binding attributes  and value on element output are mutually exclusive.  By default, the output element simply renders the plain text of the value attribute or the node indicated by the Single-Node Binding.  However, if the Single-Node Binding indicates a non-empty data node, and the media type is specified based on the mediatype attribute or mediatype child element, then the content of the data node must be decoded or dereferenced according to its datatype, and the result should be rendered according to the indicated media type if it is possible to do so (e.g. a voice-only device cannot render a digital image).   When the media type is specified, implementations may handle the output content as presentation-only or as interactive content, and interactive content may be isolated from or capable of accessing the enclosing document that contains the output.  Further implementation experience and user feedback is required.  For example, if the output content includes XForms user interface elements, it may be desirable for them to access a default XForms model in the output content or from the enclosing document. If the Single Node Binding is absent or if it does not indicate a non-empty instance node, then the media type specification is ignored if given.  Otherwise, if the Single Node Binding produces a non-empty node, and the media type is specified, then decoding or dereferencing of the instance node prior to rendition is performed by datatype as follows: If the instance node either is of type or is derived from type xsd:base64Binary, then the data is base-64 decoded. If the instance node either is of type or is derived from type xsd:hexBinary, then the data is hex-binary decoded. If the instance node either is of type or is derived from type xsd:anyURI, then the data is treated as a URI and dereferenced. If the instance node is of any other type, then the data is used without modification. If the output rendition is based on the value attribute, then the rendition is updated if the nodes referenced by the value expression change or if the content of any of the referenced nodes changes.  Otherwise, the rendition of an output is updated if the node referenced by the Single-Node Binding changes, if the content of the referenced node changes, or if the media type changes.  The media type can change by a change to the mediatype element's referenced node or its content (a host language may also allow DOM mutation of the content of the mediatype attribute or element).  A change to the label associated with the output causes an update to the rendition of the label (which may affect the layout position of the main output content). Data to be decoded does not conform to the format of xsd:base64Binary or xsd:hexBinary An error dereferencing the URI in a node of or derived from type xsd:anyURI A data format error (e.g. invalid or unsupported image format) An unrecognized media type identifier string The content model for the output element includes UI Common in order to allow action handlers for the xforms-output-error as well as to allow more comprehensive behavior and information to be provided for the output, e.g. via the hint element. Examples: A graphical browser might render an output form control as follows:    Given the model above, the following controls can upload an image to instance data and display it: A graphical browser may take into account the appearance and the localization information from the host language and present the above output form controls as follows: Lexical: 1998-01-19 Full: 19 janvier 1998 Minimal: 19/01/1998 Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Description: This form control enables the common feature found on Web sites to upload a file from the local file system, as well as accepting input from various devices including microphones, pens, and digital cameras. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional. Space-separated list of suggested media types, used by the XForms Processor to determine the possible sources of data to upload.  Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is false. Data Binding Restrictions: This form control can only be bound to datatypes xsd:anyURI, xsd:base64Binary or xsd:hexBinary, or types derived by restriction from these. This control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Implementation Requirements: For base64Binary or hexBinary data binding: When bound to an instance data node of type xsd:base64binary, xsd:hexBinary, or a type derived by restriction thereof, on activation upload places the binary content in the content of the node with the indicated encoding. Implementation Requirements: For anyURI data binding: When bound to an instance data node of type xsd:anyURI (or a type derived by restriction thereof), on activation upload places a URI in the content of the node. For security reasons, the XForms Processor must not dereference the URI bound to this form control without explicit user permission. Implementors note that upload must associate the binary content, mediatype, and filename with that URI for 11.9.6 Serialization as multipart/related and 11.9.7 Serialization as multipart/form-data serialization.  Implementations with a file system should support file upload&mdash;selecting a specific file. The types of files presented by default should reflect the mediatype specified by attribute mediatype, for example defaulting to only audio file types in the file dialog when the mediatype is "audio/*".  Implementation Requirements: For all data bindings: Implementations with specific pen/digitizer hardware should (and implementations with other pointing devices may) support scribble&mdash;allowing in-place creation of pen-based data.  Implementations with specific audio recording capabilities should support record audio&mdash;in-place recording of an audio clip.  Implementations with a digital camera, scanner interface or screen capture should support acquire image&mdash;in-place upload of images from an attached device.  Implementations with video recording capability should provide a record video option.  Implementations with 3d capabilities should provide a 3d interface option. Implementations may provide proprietary implementations (for example, a mediatype of text/rtf could invoke an edit window with a proprietary word processing application) Implementations are encouraged to support other input devices not mentioned here. Implementations which cannot support upload for the given mediatype must make this apparent to the user. See the child elements filename (8.1.6.1 The filename Element) and mediatype (8.1.6.2 The mediatype Element (for upload)).  Example: A graphical browser might render this form control as follows:    Implementation Requirements: On activation, if child element filename is present and a filename is available, upload places the filename of the data to upload in the instance at the node indicated by the binding attributes on child element filename. On activation, if child element mediatype is present and a mediatype is available, upload places the mediatype of the data to upload in the instance at the node indicated by the binding attributes on child element mediatype.  Binding attributes on author-optional element filename specify the location in the instance for the parent element upload, when activated, to place the filename for the chosen binary resource. For security reasons, upload must not take action due to any existing value of the node. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding Content: EMPTY In the following example, the user is prompted to select an image. When activated, upload places in mail/attachment either the binary data of the image or a URI for it, depending on the type declared for the mail/attachment. The filename, perhaps "me.jpg", is placed in the attribute node mail/attachment/@filename, and the mediatype, perhaps "image/jpeg" in the attribute node mail/attachment/@mediatype. Example: Binding attributes on author-optional element mediatype specify the location in the instance for the parent element upload, when activated, to place the mediatype of the chosen binary resource, if available. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding Content: EMPTY Description: This form control allows selection from a sequential range of values. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional attribute containing a  hint for the lexical starting bound for the range&mdash;a legal value for the underlying data. If provided, this value is used to further refine the constraints specified by the underlying model. Author-optional attribute containing a  hint for the ending bound for the range&mdash;a legal value for the underlying data. If provided, this value is used to further refine the constraints specified by the underlying model. Author-optional attribute containing a delta-value to use for incrementing or decrementing the value. Must be of a type capable of expressing the difference between two legal values of the underlying data. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is false. Data Binding Restrictions: Binds only the following list of datatypes, or datatypes derived by restriction from those in the list: xsd:duration, xsd:date, xsd:time, xsd:dateTime, xsd:gYearMonth, xsd:gYear, xsd:gMonthDay, xsd:gDay, xsd:gMonth, xsd:float,  xsd:double, and xsd:decimal. The above list of datatypes includes by derivation all of the integer datatypes (), all of the XForms datatypes defined in Section 5.2 XForms Datatypes that correspond to the allowed XML schema datatypes, and the datatypes defined in 5.2.4 xforms:dayTimeDuration and 5.2.5 xforms:yearMonthDuration. This control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Implementation Requirements: Must allow input of a value corresponding to the bound datatype. Implementations should inform the user of the upper and lower bounds, as well as the step size, if any. If the instance data value is outside the upper or lower bounds, this form control must indicate an out-of-range condition. In graphical environments, this form control may be rendered as a "slider" or "rotary control". In the event of overlapping restrictions between the underlying datatype and the start and end hints, the most restrictive range should be used. Notice that the attributes of this element encapsulate sufficient metadata that in conjunction with the type information available from the XForms Model proves sufficient to produce meaningful prompts when using modalities such as speech, e.g., when using an accessibility aid. Thus, in the example below, an aural user agent might speak a prompt of the form Please pick a date in the range January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001. Examples: A graphical browser might render this as follows:    Description: This form control is similar to the HTML element button and allows for user-triggered actions. This form control may also be used to construct other custom form controls. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any node. This form control does not directly interact with form data, but is affected by model item properties of the bound node, thus binding attributes are not required. Implementation Requirements: The user agent must provide a means to generate an DOMActivate event on the form control. Graphical implementations might render this form control as a push-button with the label on the button face. Style sheets can be used to style this form control as an image, hyperlink, or other presentation. "full": visually rendered as a standard button control with border."compact": visually rendered as a standard button control without border"minimal": rendered with no border, a transparent background and underline font effect.  This rendition hint is meant to be analogous to the typical visual rendition of an XHTML anchor element. Example: Description: This form control initiates a submission . Special Attributes: Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any node. This form control does not directly interact with form data, but is affected by model item properties of the bound node, thus binding attributes are not required. Example: Description: This form control allows the user to make multiple selections from a set of choices. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional attribute determining whether free entry is allowed in the list. Default is "closed". Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is true. Data Binding Restrictions: any simpleContent capable of holding a sequence. The restriction to binding simpleContent exists when the choices are authored as part of the user interface control as shown in this section. Element itemset (described in 9.3.6 The itemset Element) creates dynamic selection items and allows the available choices to be obtained from an XForms Model. When itemset uses the value element, the restriction to binding simpleContent remains in effect.  However, the itemset also allows for the selection and deselection of subtrees of instance data using the copy element, and when using that construct, the data binding restriction to simpleContent is relaxed, but the form control must bind to an element with no mixed content. Except in the case described above where the simpleContent data binding restriction is relaxed, this control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. A limitation of the XML Schema list datatypes is that white space characters in the storage values (the value element) are always interpreted as separators between individual data values. Therefore, authors should avoid using white space characters within storage values with list simpleContent. When selected, this item would introduce not one but four additional selection values: "America", "of", "States", and "United". Implementation Requirements: The label for each choice must be presented, and the control must  allow any number of selections, possibly none. When this form control uses the value element for selection, it   stores the values corresponding to the selected choices in a space separated list in the location addressed by the binding attributes. The values to be stored for selected items  are either directly specified as the contents of element value, or specified indirectly through binding attributes on element value. When this form control uses the copy element for selection, it stores copies of the subtrees corresponding to the selected choices in the location addressed by the binding attributes.  The datatype bound to this form control may include a non-enumerated value space, e.g., xsd:string, or a union of a enumeration and a non-enumerated datatype (called an open enumeration). In this case, control select may have attribute selection="open". The form control must then allow free data entry, as described in 8.1.2 The input Element. The form control may permit multiple values to be entered through free entry. For closed selections: If the  instance data matches the storage data of one or more of the selection items, those items are selected. If there is no match, no items are initially selected. If any of the stored values or subtree copies do not correspond to an item  with a matching storage value or subtree, the form control must indicate an out-of-range condition.  If the form control switches to or from being out-of-range, then xforms-out-of-range or xforms-in-range must be dispatched to the form control. For open selections: When using dynamic selections with the itemset and copy elements, open selection has no effect.  If the  instance data matches the storage values specified by one or more of the selection items, then all such matching items are selected. If any instance data list values do not match the storage value specified by one or more of the items, all such non-matching values are retained, as if entered through free entry. Free entry text is handled the same as form control input (8.1.2 The input Element), possibly in multiplicity.  For both closed and open selections, any selection item with an empty storage data subtree or a storage value that is either empty or contains only white space characters must remain deselected. Implementation Hints:  An accessibility aid might allow the user to browse through the available choices and leverage the grouping of choices in the markup to provide enhanced navigation through long lists of choices. "full": all choices should be rendered at all times."compact": a fixed number of choices should be rendered, with scrolling facilities as needed"minimal": a minimum number of choices should be rendered, with a facility to temporarily render additional choices Example: In the above example, more than one flavor can be selected. A graphical browser might render form control select as any of the following: Description: This form control allows the user to make a single selection from multiple choices. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional attribute determining whether free entry is allowed in the list. Default is "closed". Author-optional. When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is true. Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent. The restriction to binding simpleContent exists when the choices are authored as part of the user interface control as shown in this section. Element itemset (described in 9.3.6 The itemset Element) creates dynamic selection items and allows the available choices to be obtained from an XForms Model. When itemset uses the value element, the restriction to binding simpleContent remains in effect.  However, the itemset also allows for the selection and deselection of subtrees of instance data using the copy element, and when using that construct, the data binding restriction to simpleContent is relaxed, but the form control must bind to an element with no mixed content. Except in the case described above where the simpleContent data binding restriction is relaxed, this control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Implementation Requirements: The label for each choice must be presented, and the control must  allow at all times exactly one selection. When this form control uses the value element for selection, it   stores the value corresponding to the selected choice in the location addressed by the binding attributes. The value to be stored is either directly specified as the contents of element value, or specified indirectly through binding attributes on element value. When this form control uses the copy element for selection, it stores a copy of the subtree corresponding to the selected choice in the location addressed by the binding attributes.  The datatype bound to this form control may include a non-enumerated value space, e.g., xsd:string, or a union of a enumeration and a non-enumerated datatype (called an open enumeration). In this case, control select1 may have attribute selection="open". The form control must then allow free-form data entry, as described in 8.1.2 The input Element.  For closed selections: If the  instance data matches the storage data of one of the selection items, that item is selected. If there is no match, no items are initially selected. If there is no match and the storage data is non-empty, the form control must indicate an out-of-range condition.  If the form control switches to or from being out-of-range, then xforms-out-of-range or xforms-in-range must be dispatched to the form control. For open selections: When using dynamic selections with the itemset and copy elements, open selection has no effect.  If the  instance data matches the storage value specified by one of the selection items, then the first such matching item is selected. Otherwise, no items are selected and the instance data value is retained, as if entered through free text entry. Free entry text is handled the same as form control input (8.1.2 The input Element). For both closed and open selections, any selection item with a storage value which is empty or which contains only white space characters must remain deselected. Implementation Hints:  An accessibility aid might allow the user to browse through the available choices and leverage the grouping of choices in the markup to provide enhanced navigation through long lists of choices.  User interfaces may choose to render this form control as a pulldown list or group of radio buttons, among other options. The appearance attribute offers a hint as to which rendering might be most appropriate, although any styling information (such as CSS) should take precedence. Example:  In the above example, selecting one of the choices will result in the associated value given by element value on the selected item being set in the underlying instance data at the location icecream/flavor.  A graphical browser might render this form control as any of the following:  The child elements detailed below provide the ability to attach metadata to many form controls and other elements. Factoring all human readable messages to a separate resource XML file. Using URIs into this XML resource bundle within individual label elements Finally, an XForms implementation could use content negotiation to obtain the appropriate XML resource bundle, e.g., based on the accept-language headers from the client, to serve up the user interface with messages localized to the client's locale. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: None The label specified can exist in instance data or as inline text. If more than one source of label is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes,  inline text. An accessibility aid might speak the metadata encapsulated here when the containing form control gets focus.  The author-optional element help provides a convenient way to attach help information to a form control.  Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: None The message specified can exist in instance data or as inline text. If more than one source of message is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes,  inline text. An example of this element is at 10.16 The message Element.  The author-optional element hint provides a convenient way to attach hint information to a form control.  Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: None The message specified can exist in instance data or as inline text. If more than one source of message is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes,  inline text. An example of this element is at 10.16 The message Element.  The author-optional element alert provides a convenient way to attach alert or error information to a form control. Rendering of this element is implementation-defined, and there is no default level such as modal or ephemeral for the displayed message. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: None The message specified can exist in instance data or as inline text. If more than one source of message is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes,  inline text. See G XForms and Styling for examples to see how this might be presented to the user. This element is used within selection form controls to group available choices. This provides the same functionality as element optgroup in HTML. Common Attributes: Common  This element specifies the storage value and label to represent an item in a list. It is found within elements select1 and select, or grouped in element choices. Common Attributes: Common the value of a node indicated by a single node binding expression, if specified the result of evaluating an XPath expression appearing in attribute value, if specified the inline content of the value element (when neither the single node binding nor the value attribute are expressed). Special Attributes: Data Binding Restriction: All lexical values must be valid according to the datatype bound to the selection control. If the single node binding attributes are used and indicate a node in a model other than the bound node of the containing selection control, then an xforms-binding-exception must occur. Aggregation of form controls with markup defined in this chapter provides semantics about the relationship among user interface controls; such knowledge can be useful in delivering a coherent UI to small devices. For example, if the user interface needs to be split up over several screens, controls appearing inside the same aggregation would typically be rendered on the same screen or page. A group element is a container form control that allows a form author to aggregate other form controls into a single, aggregate user interface component.  The elements and attributes included in this module are: the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to empty nodeset, the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to a non-relevant instance node, the group is contained by a non-relevant switch or group (which includes a non-relevant repeat object), or the group is contained by a non-selected case element of a switch. Example: Setting the input focus on a group results in the focus being set to the first form control in the navigation order within that group. A switch element is a container form control that allows the creation of user interfaces where the user interface can be varied based on user actions and events. The elements and attributes included in this module are:  This element contains one or more case elements, any one of which is rendered at a given time. This is separate from XForms relevant processing (see 6.1.4 The relevant Property), which is based on the current state of the XForms Model. As an example, portions of a questionnaire pertaining to the user's automobile may become relevant only if the user has answered in the affirmative to the question 'Do you own a car?'. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Example: The above results in the portion of the user interface contained in the first case being displayed initially. This prompts for the user's name; filling in a value and activating the control e.g., by pressing enter results switches to the alternate case, with a read-only output rendering. Activating the trigger labeled "Edit" in turn switches back to the original case. Common Attributes: Common Special Attributes: Author-optional selection status for the case. The default value is "false". If multiple cases within a switch are marked as selected="true", the first selected case remains and all others are deselected. If none are selected, the first becomes selected.  The XForms specification allows the definition of repeating structures such as multiple items within a purchase order. When defining the XForms Model, such higher-level collections are constructed out of basic building blocks; similarly, this section defines a  container form control called  repeat that can bind to data structures such as lists and collections and provide a user interface for each node of the list or collection.. The elements and attributes included in this module are: For example:  Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Node Set Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional 1-based initial value of the repeat index. The default value is 1. Author-optional hint to the XForms Processor as to how many elements from the collection to display.  This element operates over a  repeat collection  by binding the encapsulated user interface controls to each element of the collection. If an element of the collection is non-relevant, then the rendering approach used to signify non-relevance is applied to the associated user interface controls. Attributes on this element specify how many members of the collection are presented to the user at any given time. XForms Actions insert, delete, and setindex can be used to operate on the collection&mdash;see 10 XForms Actions. Another way to view repeat processing (disregarding special user interface interactions) is to consider "unrolling" the repeat. The above example is similar to the following (given four item elements in the returned node-set):  The form controls appearing inside repeat need to be suitable for populating individual items of the collection. A simple but powerful consequence of the above is that if the XForms Model specifies nested collections, then a corresponding user interface can nest repeat elements.   It is possible to nest repeat elements to create more powerful user interface for editing structured data. H.2 Editing Hierarchical Bookmarks Using XForms is an example of a form using nested repeats to edit hierarchical data consisting of bookmarks within multiple sections. Consider the following insert statement that appears as part of that example.   The above insert statement is used in that example to add new bookmark entries into the currently selected section. The inner (nested) repeat operates on bookmarks in this selected section; The index&mdash;as returned by XForms function index&mdash;for this inner repeat starts at 1. Hence, after a new empty section of bookmarks is created and becomes current, the first insert bookmark operation adds the newly created bookmark at the front of the list.  The markup contained within the body of element repeat specifies the user interface to be generated for each repeat item of the underlying repeat collection. During user interface initialization (see 4.2.2 The xforms-model-construct-done Event), the following steps are performed for repeat: The Node Set Binding is evaluated to locate the  repeat collection  to be operated on by this repeat.  The index for this repeating structure is initialized to the value of startindex. If the initial startindex is less than 1 it defaults to 1. If the index is greater than the initial node-set then it defaults to the size of the node-set.  User interface as specified by the repeat is generated for the requisite number of members of the collection as specified by attributes on element repeat.  A new repeat item is created dynamically at any time in the lifecycle of the form (i.e. any time after xforms-model-construct-done) whenever a new node is added to the repeat collection.  There are many ways to add new nodes to a repeat collection, including but not limited to the following:  An insert action can add one or more nodes that match the repeat nodeset; The new instance data subtree created by a submission instance replacement may contain nodes that match the repeat nodeset; A setvalue action or a calculate may change a value that causes one or more nodes to match the repeat nodeset. Any time a new repeat item is created, XML Event handlers declared within the corresponding repeat object are initialized, and the user interface form controls generated for the repeat object are initialized in the same manner as the user interface initialization that is performed during default processing of xforms-model-construct-done.  For example, if the repeat object contains an inner repeat run-time object, then it is initialized according to the list of steps at the beginning of this section (9.3.3 Repeat Processing).  The processing model for repeating structures includes an index that points to the current repeat item in the  repeat collection . This repeat index is accessed via XForms function index (7.7.5 The index() Function) and manipulated via XForms Action setindex (10.5 The setindex Element). This index can be used as a reference point for insert and delete actions. Notice that the contained XForms form controls inside element repeat do not explicitly specify the index of the collection entry being populated. This is intentional; it keeps both authoring as well as the processing model simple. If one or more nodes have been added to the repeat collection by an insert action, then the repeat items corresponding to the new nodes must be created and initialized, and the repeat index must be updated to indicate the repeat item corresponding to the last node added by the insert.   The change of index on a repeat does not cause the index of any repeat nested within it to be re-initialized. The repeat item generation and repeat index update on insertion must behave as if it occurs in response to the xforms-insert event dispatched by the insert action.  The index update must behave as if it occurs when the xforms-insert event reaches the parent of the  target instance element in the capture phase. An event handler that listens for xforms-insert on instance in the default phase has access to the updated index value via function index().    A repeat item can also be destroyed dynamically at any time in the lifecycle of the form whenever a node is removed from the repeat collection.  When a repeat item is destroyed, the repeat object and all of its inner form controls are eliminated, including inner repeats, switches and groups, and all XML Event handlers created by the repeat object are eliminated.  There are many ways to remove repeat items from a repeat collection, including but not limited to the following:  A delete action can remove nodes that matched the repeat nodeset; The new instance data subtree created by a submission instance replacement may replace nodes that matched the repeat nodeset; A setvalue action or a calculate may change a value that causes one or more nodes to stop matching the repeat nodeset. If one or more nodes have been removed from the repeat collection by a delete action, then the repeat items corresponding to the deleted nodes must be destroyed and the repeat index must be updated based on the rules below.   The change of index on a repeat does not cause the index of any repeat nested within it to be re-initialized. The repeat index update on deletion behaves as if it occurs in response to the xforms-delete event dispatched by the delete action.  Specifically, the index update behaves as if it occurs when the xforms-delete event reaches the parent of the  target instance element in the capture phase.  Element repeat enables the binding of user interaction to a node-set, referred to as  repeat collection. The number of displayed items might be less than the total number available in the collection. In this case, the presentation would render only a portion of the repeating items at a given time. For example, a graphical user interface might present a scrolling table. The current item indicated by the repeat index should be made available to the user at all times, for example, not allowed to scroll out of view. The XForms Actions enumerated at 10 XForms Actions may be used within event listeners to manipulate the  repeat collection  being populated by scrolling, inserting, and deleting entries.  Notice that the markup encapsulated by element repeat acts as the template for the user interface that is presented to the user. As a consequence, statically authored IDREF attributes must be interpreted based on a combination of repeat indexes and where the IDREF attributes appear relative to the element bearing the matching ID. Based on the IDREF resolution rules given in 4.7 Resolving ID References in XForms, it is possible to toggle the case of a switch even when it is within one or more repeat elements.  Similarly, it is possible to set the focus to controls and dispatch events to elements that are within one or more repeat elements. If the focus is transferred to a form control within a repeat by any means, such as by an XForms action or by user interaction, the index of the repeat is updated to indicate the item of the  repeat collection  that contains the control. If the repeat item containing the focused control contains any inner repeat objects, their indexes are not changed. However,   the repeat index update is recursive for all outer repeats that contain the focused control; the index of each outer containing repeat is adjusted appropriately. These changes of repeat index occurs as if by invoking the setindex action.  Element repeat enables the creation of user interfaces for populating repeating structures. When using XForms within host languages like XHTML, it is often necessary to create repeating structures within constructs such as table. Thus, one might wish to use element repeat within a table to create the rows of a table, where each row of the table binds to a distinct member of a repeat collection. Since html:table doesn't  (and perhaps  never will) allow xforms:repeat elements as children, another syntax is needed. More generally, there is a need to integrate repeat behavior into host languages at points where the content model of the host language does not or cannot provide the appropriate extension hooks via modularization. To accommodate this, XForms defines an alternative syntax that is functionally equivalent to the repeat element, using the following attributes:   repeat-model  repeat-bind  repeat-nodeset  repeat-startindex  repeat-number    The above attributes are equivalent to the repeat attributes of the same name, but without the prefix repeat-. A host language can include these attributes in the appropriate places to enable repeating constructs. For example, a version of XHTML might use: Which could be validated against an appropriately configured XHTML Schema that includes the XForms Repeat module. Note that what gets repeated is the child elements of the element with the repeat- attributes. Additionally, when using XForms Action setindex, attribute repeat of type idref can point to any element carrying the repeat attributes. Similarly, when using function index against a repeating structure created via the repeat-attributes, the id of that element can be used as the argument to function index. This element allows the creation of dynamic selections within controls select and select1, where the available choices are determined at run-time. The node-set that holds the available choices is specified via the Node Set Binding. Child elements label and value indirectly specify the label and storage values. Notice that the run-time effect of itemset is the same as using element choices with child item elements  to statically author the available choices. For each node of the Node Set Binding, an associated item element is created.  XForms Actions appearing in the content of an itemset are created within each item element, and the in-scope evaluation context for these XForms Actions is based on the node for which the item was generated as described in Section 7.2 Evaluation Context.  As with the repeat element, the itemset template content, including XForms Actions, is made unavailable.  Copies of the itemset template content, including XForms Actions, are made available via repeated item objects.  Common Attributes: Common, Node Set Binding Whenever a refresh event is dispatched the nodeset is re-evaluated to update the list of available choices.  The following example shows element itemset within control select to specify a dynamic list of ice cream flavors: Structurally, this element is similar to 8.3.3 The value Element. It differs in that it can only be used within itemset, and that it works with subtrees of instance data rather than simple values.  Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) If the single node binding attributes indicate a node in a model other than the bound node of the containing selection control, then an xforms-binding-exception must occur.. When a copy item is  selected, the following rules apply: The target node, selected by the binding attributes on the list form control, must be an element node, otherwise an exception results (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). The element node associated with the item, selected by the binding attributes on copy, is deep copied as a child of the target node  by using  an insert action  (10.3 The insert Element). A full computational dependency rebuild is done, followed by recalculate, revalidate, and refresh. When a copy item is deselected, the following rules apply: The target node, selected by the binding attributes on the list form control, must be an element node, otherwise an exception results (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). The child element node associated with the item, selected by the binding attributes on copy, is deleted  by using  a delete action  (10.4 The delete Element). A full computational dependency rebuild, followed by recalculate, revalidate, and refresh. If the target node of the select or select1 is readonly, then the insertion or deletion associated with the copy operation is not performed. This chapter defines the controller layer of XForms,  an XML Events-based [XML Events] common set of actions that can be invoked in response to events.  XForms itself defines no method for script-based event handling. The definition of such facilities is a responsibility of the hosting language.  All form controls as well as other elements defined in this specification have a set of common behaviors that encourage consistent authoring and look and feel for XForms-based applications. This consistency comes from attaching a common set of behaviors to the various form controls. In conjunction with the event binding mechanism provided by XML Events, these handlers provide a flexible means for forms authors to specify event processing at appropriate points within the XForms user interface. XForms Actions are declarative XML event handlers that capture high-level semantics. As a consequence, they significantly enhance the accessibility of XForms-based applications in comparison to previous Web technologies that relied exclusively on scripting. The elements and attributes included in this module are: The following group of attributes, here called Action Common, are available to all Action elements: Author-optional attribute defined in Section 10.17 Conditional Execution of XForms Actions. Author-optional attribute defined in Section 10.18 Iteration of XForms Actions. The following example shows how events can be used: This example recreates the behavior of the HTML reset control, which this specification does not define as an independent form control.  For each built-in XForms Action, this chapter lists the following: NameCommon AttributesSpecial AttributesDescription of behavior All elements defined in this chapter explicitly allow global attributes from the XML Events namespace, and apply the processing defined in that specification in section 2.3 [XML Events]. By default, the behavior of an action handler is performed one time when the action is encountered in the execution sequence.  However, execution of an action handler may be conditional or iterated, as described in 10.17 Conditional Execution of XForms Actions and 10.18 Iteration of XForms Actions. Execution of an outermost action handler begins by setting the XForms processor into the state of executing an outermost action handler.  The outermost action handler is then performed, which may include the execution of inner action handlers.  Finally, the XForms processor is set into the state of not executing an outermost action handler and then the deferred update is performed for each model.  The XForms processor is not considered to be executing an outermost action handler at the time that it performs deferred update behavior for XForms models.  Therefore, event handlers for events dispatched to the user interface during the deferred refresh behavior are considered to be new outermost action handler. Actions that manipulate properties of the XForms view layer begin by invoking the deferred update behavior so that the model and all data are up to date prior to performing the action.  The XForms Actions in this category are: setfocustogglesetindex Actions that directly invoke rebuild, recalculate, revalidate, or refresh always have an immediate effect, and clear the corresponding deferred update flag. The XForms Actions in this category are: rebuildrecalculaterevalidaterefresh Similarly, if the default processing of any of the events xforms-rebuild, xforms-recalculate, xforms-revalidate, or xforms-refresh are performed, then the corresponding deferred update flag is cleared.  The XForms Actions that can dispatch these events are:  resetdispatch XForms Actions that change the tree structure of instance data result in setting all four deferred update flags to true  for the model over which they operate. The XForms Actions in this category are: insertdelete XForms Actions that change only the value of an instance node results in setting the deferred update flags for recalculate, revalidate, and refresh to true and making no change to the deferred update flag for rebuild  for the model over which they operate. The XForms Actions in this category are: setvaluesetindex Finally, the XForms submission process can affect deferred update behavior.  See Section 11.2 The xforms-submit Event for details. XForms actions that are capable of initiating an XForms submission are: senddispatch This action causes its child actions to be invoked in the order that they are specified in the document. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: The element content of setvalue specifies the literal value to set; this is an alternative to specifying a computed value via attribute value. If neither a value attribute nor text content are present, the effect is to set the value of the selected node to the empty string (""). If both are present, the value attribute is used. The following  examples contrast these approaches: This causes the string value at a/b/c in the instance data to be placed on the single node selected by the bind element with id="put-here". This causes the value "literal string" to be placed on the single node selected by the bind element with id="put-here". All strings are inserted into the instance data as follows: Attribute nodes: The string-value of the attribute is replaced with a string corresponding to the new value. Text nodes: The text node is replaced with a new one corresponding to the new value, or the text node is eliminated if the new value is the empty string. Namespace, processing instruction, and comment nodes: behavior is undefined (implementation-dependent). the XPath root node: an xforms-binding-exception occurs.  This action affects deferred updates by setting the deferred update flags for recalculate, revalidate and refresh. Special Attributes: The XForms action system's deferred update flags for rebuild, recalculate, revalidate and refresh are set.  This action affects deferred updates by setting the deferred update flags for rebuild, recalculate, revalidate and refresh. Examples: See 10.4 The delete Element for an example that uses insert and delete to make a repeat that always shows at least one repeat item. See Appendix B Patterns for Data Mutations for numerous further usage patterns for sevalue,  insert and delete. This action deletes one or more nodes from instance data. Special Attributes:  This action affects deferred updates by setting the deferred update flags for rebuild, recalculate, revalidate and refresh. Examples:  See Appendix B Patterns for Data Mutations for numerous further usage patterns for sevalue,  insert and delete. Special Attributes: Required reference to a repeating element. If the selected index is 0 or less, an xforms-scroll-first event is dispatched and the index is set to 1. If the selected index is greater than the index of the last repeat item, an xforms-scroll-last event is dispatched and the index is set to that of the last item. If the index evaluates to NaN the action has no effect.   This action affects deferred updates by performing deferred update in its initialization and by setting the deferred update flags for recalculate, revalidate and refresh. This action  performs the following: Dispatches an xforms-deselect event to the currently selected case  in the switch containing the identified case. Adjusts the selected states (not the attribute values) on the affected cases to reflect the new state of the switch containing the identified case. Dispatches an xform-select event to the case just selected. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common Special Attributes: The case to be selected by the switch is identified by IDREF either by the attribute case or by a child case element. If no case element contains the given identifier, then this action has no effect.  This action affects deferred updates by performing deferred update in its initialization.

The document is loaded into a new presentation context, e.g., a new window. Form processing in the original window continues. The document is loaded into the current window. Form processing is interrupted, exactly as if the user had manually requested navigating to a new document. Common Attributes: None Special Attributes: Content: PCDATA This action initiates submit processing by dispatching an xforms-submit event.

Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common Special Attributes: Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: The message specified can exist in instance data or as inline text. If more than one source of message is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes,  inline text. The user interface for the message action is considered to be created at the time the action occurs.  If the message is obtained from the inline content of the message action, then the output of any output controls in the message content is determined based on the instance data available when the message action occurs.  For example, the following example displays the message Hello, world! as the form starts up: In this example, the message includes the latest user input even though other form controls not in the message action are not guaranteed to be updated until the end of the xforms-refresh event processing: Due to deferred update behavior, if a message action is preceded in an action sequence by other actions that change instance nodes, and the message references nodes that are computationally dependent on the changed nodes, then the form author should invoke the recalculate action before the message action. Moreover, if the computational dependencies involved nodes that were inserted or deleted, then the form author should invoke rebuild prior to the recalculate. A graphical browser might render a modal message as follows:   A modeless message is the foundation for displaying a help message, which a graphical browser might render as follows:    An ephemeral message is the foundation for displaying a hint message, which a graphical browser might render as follows:    In actions insert and delete, the attribute context is evaluated before the if attribute. Counter and accumlator variables are created in instance data to sum a selection of values chosen by the user XForms is designed to gather instance data, serialize it into an external representation, and submit it with a protocol. XForms defines a set of options for serialization and submission. The following sections define the processing of instance data for submission, and the behavior for the serialization and submission options. The submission element represents declarative instructions on what to submit, and how.

Common Attributes: Common Special Attributes: Author-optional selector binding expression enabling submission of a portion of the instance data. The selected node, and all descendants, are selected for submission. The default value is "/". Author-optional reference to a bind element. When present, the binding reference on this attribute is used in preference to any binding reference from the ref attribute. Author-optional boolean attribute that indicates whether or not the data validation checks of the submission are performed. The default value is "false" if the value of serialization is "none" and "true" otherwise. Author-optional boolean attribute that indicates whether or not the relevance pruning of the submission is performed. The default value is "false" if the value of serialization is "none" and "true" otherwise. Author-optional attribute specifying the version of XML to be serialized. The default is "1.0". Author-optional attribute specifying whether the serializer should add extra white space nodes for readability. The default is "false". Author-optional attribute specifying the mediatype for XML  serialization  of instance data. Authors should ensure that the type specified is compatible with the data being submitted, such as application/xml for posted XML data. The default is "application/xml". This attribute does not affect serialization and cannot be used to override the serialization attribute.  It is only used to provide additional information about the submission data serialization when the serialization is application/xml.  For example, this attribute could be used to indicate that the content type of the XML serialization is text/xml. Author-optional attribute specifying an encoding for serialization. The default is "UTF-8". Author-optional attribute specifying whether to omit the XML declaration on the serialized instance data. The default value is "false". Author-optional attribute specifying whether to include a standalone declaration in the serialized XML.If the omit-xml-declaration attribute has the value true, then this attribute is ignored.  Otherwise, if this attribute is omitted, then the XML declaration does not include a standalone document declaration, and if this attribute is specified, then the XML declaration includes a standalone document declaration with the same value as this attribute. Author-optional attribute specifying element names to be serialized with CDATA sections. The default is empty string. Author-optional attribute providing control over namespace serialization. If absent, all namespace nodes present in the instance data are considered for serialization. If present, specifies list of namespace prefixes to consider for serialization, in addition to those visibly utilized. As in [Exc-C14N], the special value #default specifies the default namespace. The following examples show how various options on element submission can affect serialization as application/xml. Given the following XForms fragment: Note that the includenamespaceprefixes attribute is not present, which causes all namespace nodes to be serialized, resulting in the following serialized instance data: In particular, note that the XForms namespace has been serialized. To prevent this example from including the unneeded XForms namespace while maintaining the needed my prefix, includenamespaceprefixes="my" must be added to the submission element. When this attribute is present, the author takes responsibility to list all namespace prefixes not visibly utilized by the submitted instance data. The following attributes correspond (in spelling, processing, and default values) to attributes on the output element of [XSLT 1.0], with the exception of using xsd:boolean to replace "yes"|"no": versionindentencodingomit-xml-declarationcdata-section-elements The following XSLT attributes have no counterpart in XForms: doctype-systemdoctype-public The table below provides an overview of the child elements of the XForms submission element, including their attributes and content models. Elements defined in the XForms Actions module are also allowed in the content model of submission. Target: submission Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None Otherwise, the default action for this event results in the following steps: The submission method is determined. The submission resource is determined. If the resource is not specified, then submission processing stops after dispatching even xforms-submit-error with context information containing an error-type of resource-error. The response returned from the submission is applied as follows:  Behaviors of other possible values for attribute replace are not defined in this specification. In addition to initiating a submission with its default processing, XForms actions can also provide handlers for the xforms-submit event to peform tasks such as data preparation. Example:  The schema for the doctor search service requires certain portions of the patient record in order to provide a list of specialists who could treat the patient.  The server-side module may perform database searches for doctors with the required specialties as well as implement business rules such as providing doctors that are within an acceptable distance of the given city. The resulting list is provided to a separate instance so it can be presented to the user for selection or used in subsequent availability searches. Dispatched at the beginning of submission serialization (see 11.2 The xforms-submit Event). Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: Since the submission-body is a string, this feature may be used to submit non-XML data. Example:  The string value of the element my/text is placed into the node representing the submission body, so that is the text posted by the submission.  In this example, the result returned by the submission replaces the document.  This feature could be used to submit plain text, but it could also be used to allow a document to submit its serialization rather than just submitting instance data. Dispatched as an indication of: successful completion of a submission process Target: submission Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info:  Default Action: None; notification event only. Example:  Dispatched as an indication of: failure of a submission process Target: submission Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: Default Action: None; notification event only. Example:  The submission resource is the URI for the submission.  It is of type xsd:anyURI. The resource element allows the URI used for a submission to be dynamically calculated based on instance data.   Common Attributes: None Special Attributes: Content: PCDATA Example:  The submission method indicates the submission protocol operation to be performed. The method element allows the submission method to be dynamically calculated based on instance data. Common Attributes: None Special Attributes: Content: PCDATA Common Attributes: None Special Attributes: document order of header elements node order of nodes in nodeset attribute document order of value elements The application of this order information to header serialization is determined by the submission protocol. Example:  In the example below, the submission request uses the header element to replace the user agent's existing value of the HTTP Accept header with application/sparql-results+xml. Common Attributes: None Special Attributes: Common Attributes: None Special Attributes: the submission resource the submission method the header elements Other bindings, in particular to the URI scheme "mailto:" may, and the schemes "https:" and "file:" should, be supported. Bindings to these schemes are not normatively defined in XForms. Implementations that choose to provide a binding to these schemes should pay particular attention to privacy and security concerns. Within the "http:" and "https:" schemes, form creators are encouraged to follow the finding of the W3C Technical Architecture Group on when to use the GET method: [TAG Finding 7] The submission method determines the default data serialization format, and both the submission method and the URI scheme in the submission resource determine the submission protocol operation, according to the following table: Foreign-namespaced attribute values are allowed in the Submission Method, but no behavior is defined by XForms. This submit method represents HTTP GET or the equivalent concept. The serialized form data is delivered as part of the URI that is requested during the submit process. This method is not suitable for submission of forms that are intended to change state or cause other actions to take place at the server. See [RFC 2616] for recommended uses of HTTP GET. The URI is constructed as follows: The submit URI is examined. If it does not already contain a ? (question mark) character, one is appended. If it does already contain a question mark character and the serialized form data is non-empty, then a separator character from the attribute separator is appended. The serialized form data, if any,  is appended to the URI. No message body is sent with the request. Examples:  These submit methods represent HTTP POST or the equivalent concept (such as a mail message). The serialized form data is delivered as the message body. Examples: Submits the XML for a purchase order to a secure server order processing system. This submit method represents HTTP PUT or the equivalent concept (such as writing to a local file). The serialized form data is delivered as the message body. Example: This format permits the expression of the instance data as XML that is straightforward to process with off-the-shelf XML processing tools. In addition, this format is capable of submission of binary content. The steps for serialization are as follows: An XML document is produced following the rules of the XML output method defined in [XSLT 1.0] section 16 and 16.1, using the values supplied as attributes of the submission element. Handling of namespace nodes: The default behavior is that every namespace node is serialized according to the rules of the XML output method, so that at least one namespace declaration appears in the serialized XML for each in-scope namespace. Additional inherited namespaces are declared on the root element of the serialized XML. If, however, attribute includenamespaceprefixes on element submission is present, then all namespace declarations not visibly utilized in the instance data (as defined in [Exc-C14N]) and the default namespace if it is empty are excluded from the root element serialization, unless the corresponding namespace prefix is listed in the includenamespaceprefixes attribute. The special value #default represents the default namespace.  Mediatype: By default, the mediatype of the serialized XML instance is application/xml, but can be changed to a compatible type using element submission attribute mediatype. Authors should ensure that the type specified is compatible with application/xml. This format is intended for integration of XForms into environments that involve large amounts of binary data where the inclusion of the data as xsd:base64Binary or xsd:hexBinary is undesirable. In this format, XML instance data is serialized as one part of the [RFC 2387] multipart/related message, using the rules as described in 11.9.5 Serialization as application/xml. Binary content from xsd:anyURI instance nodes populated by the upload (see 8.1.6 The upload Element) control is serialized in separate parts of the [RFC 2387] multipart/related message. This format follows the rules of multipart/related MIME data streams for in [RFC 2387], with specific requirements of this serialization listed below: multipart/related message header requirements: Must contain a type parameter of the mediatype of the serialized XML instance. Must contain a start parameter referring to the Content-ID first body part (root). First body part (root) requirements: Must have Content-Type parameter of the type specified by the submission mediatype attribute. Content is serialized by the rules at 11.9.5 Serialization as application/xml. Subsequent part requirements: One part for each node with a datatype of xsd:anyURI populated by upload with: A Content-Type header that represents the type of the attachment if known, otherwise application/octet-stream. A Content-Transfer-Encoding header. A Content-ID header whose value matches the URI in the associated instance data node. The binary content associated with the URI, serialized according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding heading. Submits the instance data in multipart/related, along with the selected file as an attachment. This format is for legacy compatibility to permit the use of XForms clients with [RFC 2388] servers. This method is suitable for the persistence of binary content. Contextual path information, attribute values, namespaces and namespace prefixes are not preserved. As a result, different elements might serialize to the same name. Existing HTML user agents fail to encode special characters (such as double quotes) and non-ASCII characters in the Content-Disposition: form-data name and filename parameters. Since this serialization method is supported for legacy applications only, new applications should use application/xml or multipart/related.  This format follows the rules for multipart/form-data MIME data streams in [RFC 2388], with specific requirements of this serialization listed below: Each element node is visited in document order, except non-relevant elements are skipped if the relevant setting of the submission is true. Each visited element that has no child element nodes (i.e., each leaf element node) is selected for inclusion, including those that have no value (no text node). Element nodes selected for inclusion are  encoded as Content-Disposition: form-data MIME parts as defined in [RFC 2388], with the name parameter being the element local name. Element nodes of any datatype populated by upload also have a Content-Disposition filename parameter, if the filename is available.  Element nodes of any datatype not populated by upload are serialized as the string value of the element (the concatenation of all text node children, or empty string if the element has no text node children). The Content-Type must be text/plain except for xsd:anyURI, xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary, and derived types, in which case the header represents the media type of the attachment if known, otherwise application/octet-stream. If a character set is applicable, the Content-Type may have a charset parameter. Example: Submits the instance data in multipart/form-data, along with the selected file as a part. This format represents an extension of the [XHTML 1.0] form content type application/x-www-form-urlencoded with specific rules for encoding non-ASCII and reserved characters. This format is not suitable for the persistence of binary content. Therefore, it is recommended that forms capable of containing binary content use another serialization method. The steps for serialization are as follows: Element nodes selected for inclusion are encoded as EltName=value, where = is a literal character, EltName represents the element local name, and value represents the string value of the element (the concatenation of all text node children, or empty string if the element has no text node children). The separator character {sep} from the separator attribute on submission is used between pairs of encoded name/value pairs, e.g. EltName1=value1{sep}EltName2=value2{sep}EltName3=value3. Note that contextual path information is not preserved, nor are namespaces or namespace prefixes. As a result, different elements might serialize to the same name. The encoding of EltName and value are as follows: space characters are replaced by +, and then non-ASCII and reserved characters (as defined by [RFC 2396] as amended by subsequent documents in the IETF track) are escaped by replacing the character with one or more octets of the UTF-8 representation of the character, with each octet in turn replaced by %HH, where HH represents the uppercase hexadecimal notation for the octet value and % is a literal character. Line breaks are represented as "CR LF" pairs (i.e., %0D%0A).  All such encodings are concatenated, maintaining document order. Example: This format consists of simple name-value pairs. Here is the instance data for the above example. Note that very little of the data is preserved. Authors desiring greater data integrity should select a different serialization format. The processing of the targetref attribute (and its default) is considered to have failed if the result is any of the following: an empty nodeset a readonly node, if replace="text" a non-element, if replace="instance" a node whose parent is readonly, if replace="instance" Examples: The address information is past to a postal code search service that returns a textual result, which is placed into the postalCode element. The single-node binding of the submission element refers to the XML data to be submitted.  In the case of a SOAP submission, the instance data includes the SOAP envelope and related SOAP tags. The form author may choose to store the data payload in one instance and copy the data to the submission instance containing the SOAP envelope as part of an xforms-submit event handler.  The form author is responsible for declaring the appropriate model item properties on both instances (e.g. the relevant declarations). The action MIME parameter has no effect unless the submission method is "post" because the GET method implies no SOAP processing by the receiving SOAP node. SOAP 1.1 does not support the HTTP GET operation. If method="get", then the SOAP response message exchange pattern is used.  The HTTP headers must contain the Accept parameter with a value conforming to the following properties: If the submission mediatype contains a charset MIME parameter, then it is appended to the application/soap+xml MIME type. Otherwise, a charset MIME parameter with same value as the encoding attribute (or its default) is appended to the application/soap+xml MIME type. No other MIME parameters from the mediatype are copied to the application/soap+xml MIME type The q MIME parameter must not be specified in the application/soap+xml MIME type so that the default quality of 1 is used. If method="post", then the SOAP request-response message exchange pattern is used.  For SOAP 1.2, the current submission behavior of using the mediatype attribute value as the value of the Content-type parameter in the HTTP headers is sufficient.  If the instance data being submitted has as its root element node a SOAP envelope in the SOAP 1.1 namespace (http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/), then:  if the action MIME parameter appears in the mediatype then a SOAPAction HTTP header is added and given a value equal to the content of the action MIME parameter XForms 1.1 does not support the SOAP email binding, so method="post" with a mailto: scheme results in an xforms-submit-error event before any submit processing message is dispatched. XForms 1.1 does not support the SOAP 1.1 binding to the HTTP Extension Framework. Example: The submission and the request and response instances correspond to the web service definition below: The XForms processor must handle client authorization and redirection. SOAP faults (400 and 500 level errors) are handled in the same manner as underlying HTTP errors, which is to say that an xforms-submit-error event is dispatched. On successful completion, the results are consumed according to the XForms submission process, culminating in an xforms-submit-done event.  The form author may capture this event and copy data from the target instance that receives the returned SOAP envelope to other instances that are designed to carry only data.

The XForms Model defines the individual model items and constraints and other run-time aspects of XForms.]   [Definition: A software application or program that implements and conforms to the XForms specification.]  This appendix provides several usage patterns for the setvalue,  insert and delete actions that perform various kinds of mutations of instance data elements and attributes. Pattern: &lt;insert context="parent of new element" origin="element to copy"/&gt; Operation: Prepend a new, empty person element into a list of people Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;insert context="parent of new element" nodeset="*" origin="element to copy"/&gt; Operation: Append a new, empty person element into a list of people Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;insert nodeset="exact element to duplicate"/&gt; The context attribute is not used because this pattern assumes the ability to indicate an exact element to duplicate, so nodeset is used. If the element does not exist, the operation will have no effect. Operation: Duplicate the selected element and place it as a following sibling Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;insert context="container element receiving attribute" origin="attribute to copy"/&gt; The nodeset attribute is not used because this pattern cannot indicate an exact attribute sibling of the attribute being inserted.  This is true not only because attribute order is not guaranteed but also because the attribute being inserted may already exist, in which case the existing attribute is replaced. The context attribute is used when it is necessary to indicate the parent of the node being inserted. Operation: Create or replace an attribute with a copy of a given attribute Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;delete nodeset="exact element to remove"/&gt; The context attribute is not used because this pattern assumes the ability to indicate an exact element to remove, so nodeset is used. If the element does not exist, the operation will have no effect. Operation: Remove item element in case it exists Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;delete nodeset="exact attribute to remove"/&gt; The context attribute is not used because this pattern assumes the ability to indicate an exact attribute to remove, so nodeset is used. If the attribute does not exist, the operation will have no effect. Operation: Remove rating attribute in case it exists Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;delete nodeset="nodeset to remove"/&gt; The context attribute is not used because this pattern assumes the ability to indicate a nodeset to remove, so nodeset is used. If the nodeset does not exist, the operation will have no effect. Operation: Remove track nodeset in case it exists Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;insert context="parent of new nodeset" nodeset="*" origin="nodeset to copy"/&gt; The context attribute is used so that this pattern will work whether or not the parent element is empty. Operation: Append a person nodeset into a list of people  Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;insert context="exact element receiving attribute list" origin="attribute list to copy"/&gt; Operation: Copy attribute list from one item to another Data Before Operation Data After Operation The context attribute is not used because this pattern assumes the ability to indicate an exact element to replace, so nodeset is used. If the element does not exist, both insert and delete operation will have no effect. Operation: Replace a person element by copying a new one and removing the old one Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;setvalue ref="exact attribute to replace" value="attribute to copy"/&gt; If the attribute does not exist, the operation will have no effect. Operation: Replace an attribute with the copy of a given attribute Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;insert nodeset="root node of instance to replace" origin="element to copy"/&gt; The context attribute is not used because this pattern assumes the ability to indicate an instance root node to replace, so nodeset is used. Since an instance cannot be empty, nodeset will always be non-empty. Insert implements special handling for instance root nodes, thus a delete operation is not necessary. Operation: Replace instance root node with an empty shoppingcart element Data Before Operation Data After Operation Operation: Copy an existing element to a new parent and remove the original Data Before Operation Data After Operation If the attribute to be moved does not exist, both insert and delete operation will have no effect. Operation: Copy an existing attribute to a new element and remove the original Data Before Operation Data After Operation The context attribute is not used because it adheres to the first node rule and therefore would not allow to select a non-contiguous nodeset. The nodeset attribute is used instead to select a nodeset consisting of nodes with different names and different parents. The parent of the new node is the same as the parent of the insert location node selected by the combination of nodeset and at. Operation: Copy an existing element into a non-contiguous, heterogeneous nodeset at a specified position Data Before Operation Data After Operation XForms Processors are free (and encouraged) to skip or optimize any steps in this algorithm, as long as the end result is the same. The XForms recalculation algorithm considers model items and model item properties to be vertices in a directed graph. Edges between the vertices represent computational dependencies between vertices. Following is the default handling for a recalculate action. Action recalculate is defined in 10.10 The recalculate Element. A master dependency directed graph is created as detailed in C.1 Details on Creating the Master Dependency Directed Graph. To provide consistent behavior, implementations must reduce the number of vertices to be processed by computing a pertinent dependency subgraph consisting only of vertices and edges that are reachable from nodes that require recomputation. This is detailed in C.2 Details on Creating the Pertinent Dependency Subgraph. Note that on a first recomputation (such as on form load), the pertinent dependency subgraph will be the same as the master dependency directed graph. A topological sort is performed on the vertices of the pertinent dependency subgraph, resulting in an order of evaluation in which each vertex is evaluated only after those vertices on which it depends and before all vertices which depend on it. The topological sort algorithm is discussed at [Algorithms]. The recalculate process completes. The master dependency directed graph can be considered an array with one record for each vertex, each having the following fields: InstanceNode: a reference to the associated instance data nodetype: indicates the aspect of the instance node represented by the vertex (the text content or a model item property such as readOnly or required)depList: a list of vertices that refer to this vertexin-degree: the number of vertices on which this vertex dependsvisited: a flag used to ensure vertices are not added to a subgraph multiple timesindex: an association between vertices in the master dependency directed graph and a subgraph The depList for each vertex is assigned based on  the referenced XML nodes of  instance nodes, which are obtained by parsing the computed expression bound to the node (e.g., by calculate, relevant, readonly, or required). Any expression violating any Binding Expression Constraint causes an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event), terminating the recalculate process. Specifically, the depList for a vertex v is assigned to be the vertices other than v whose computational expressions reference v (described below). Vertex v is excluded from its own depList to allow self-references to occur without causing a circular reference exception. A computational expression appearing in a calculate attribute controls the text content (value) of one or more instance nodes. A vertex exists for each instance node to represent the expression in the context of the node. Likewise, computational expressions for model item properties such as readOnly and required are applied to one or more instance nodes, and vertices are created to represent such expressions in the context of each applicable node. The computational expression of each vertex must be examined to determine the XML nodes to which it refers. Any expression violating any Binding Expression Constraint causes an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event), terminating the recalculate process. A computation expression refers to a vertex v if a subexpression indicates the InstanceNode for v and v represents the instance node text content (its value). In this version of XForms, model item properties such as readOnly and required cannot be referenced in an expression. If all calculations must be performed, which is the case on form load, then the pertinent dependency subgraph is simply a duplicate of the master dependency directed graph. If the recalculation algorithm is invoked with a list of changed instance data nodes since the last recalculation, then the pertinent dependency subgraph is obtained by exploring the paths of edges and vertices in the computational dependency directed graph that are reachable from each vertex in the change list. The method of path exploration can be depth first search, a suitable version of which appears in the pseudo-code below. This algorithm creates a pertinent dependency subgraph S from a list of changed instance data nodes L&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. Variables such as v and w represent vertices in the master dependency directed graph. The same variables ending with S indicate vertices in the pertinent dependency subgraph S. Note that the number of vertices and dependency nodes in the pertinent dependency subgraph is not known beforehand, but a method such as array doubling (see [DDJ-ArrayDoubling]) can be used to ensure that building the subgraph is performed in time linear in the size of S. The following steps process vertices, resulting in a recalculated form: A vertex with inDegree of 0 is selected for evaluation and removed from the pertinent dependency subgraph. In the case where more than one vertex has inDegree zero, no particular ordering is specified. If the pertinent dependency subgraph contains vertices, but none have an inDegree of 0, then the calculation structure of the form has a loop, and an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event) must be thrown, terminating processing. If the vertex corresponds to a computed item, computed expressions are evaluated as follows: calculate: If the value of the model item changes, the corresponding instance data is updated and the dirty flag is set. relevant, readonly, required, constraint: If any or all of these computed properties change, the new settings are  placed into effect for associated form controls. For each vertex in the depList of the removed vertex, decrement the inDegree by 1. If no vertices remain in the pertinent dependency subgraph, then the calculation has successfully completed. Otherwise, repeat this sequence from step 1. For example, consider six vertices a, b, v, w, x, and y. Let a and b represent the text content of instance nodes that will be set by a binding from user input controls. Let v and w be vertices representing the calculated value and the validity property of a third instance node c. These vertices would result from a bind element B with calculate and constraint attributes and a nodeset attribute that indicates c. Suppose that the value of c is the product of a and b and that the value is only valid if it does not exceed 100. Likewise, suppose x and y are vertices representing the calculated value and the validity property of a fourth instance node d. Let the value of d be the sum of a and b, and let d be valid if the value does not exceed 20. The figure below depicts the dependency digraph for this example.    Vertices a and b have edges leading to v and x because these vertices represent the calculate expressions of c and d, which reference a and b to compute their product and sum, respectively. Similarly, v and x have directed edges to w and y, respectively, because w and y represent the constraint expressions of c and d, which reference the values of c and d to compare them with boundary values. If a and b are initially equal to 10, and the user changes a to 11, then it is necessary to first recalculate v (the value of c) then recalculate w (the validity property of the value of c). Likewise, x (the value of d) must be recalculated before recalculating y (the validity property of the value of d). In both cases, the validity of the value does not change to false until after the new product and sum are computed based on the change to a. However, there are no interdependencies between v and x, so the product and sum could be computed in either order. The pertinent subgraph excludes b and only vertex a has in-degree of zero. The vertex a is processed first. It is not a computed vertex, so no recalculation occurs on a, but its removal causes v and x to have in-degree zero. Vertex v is processed second. Its value changes to 121, and its removal drops the in-degree of vertex w to zero. Vertex x is processed next, changing value to 21. When x is removed, its neighbor y drops to in-degree zero. The fourth and fifth iterations of this process recalculate the validity of w and y, both of which change to false. P3P privacy policies may be associated with any forms transmitted over HTTP that have URIs associated with them. In the future, mechanisms may be specified for associating P3P policies with content transmitted over other protocols.  P3P allows for policies to be associated with an individual URI or a set of URIs. By associating a separate policy with each URI a site can declare a very precise policy that addresses exactly what data is collected with a particular HTTP request and how that data will be used. However, site management is substantially easier for many sites if they declare a single policy that covers many URIs, or even their entire Web presence.  The P3P specification specifies several methods for referencing a P3P policy reference file, which in turn associates P3P policies with URIs and cookies. XForms can be P3P enabled using any of the methods that are appropriate for the Web site in which they are embedded. Some special considerations regarding forms are addressed in the P3P Specification. [P3P 1.0]  Different P3P policies may be applied to the representation of a form embedded in a containing document to that which is associated with the data submitted via that form. If the form representation is served from a different server than the form is submitted to, it is likely that separate P3P policy reference files and policies will be needed. Typically the form representation causes only clickstream data (as defined in [P3P 1.0] section 5.6.4) to be transferred, while a form submission causes much more data to be transferred.  The attribute inputmode provides a hint to the user agent to select an appropriate input mode for the text input expected in an associated form control. The input mode may be a keyboard configuration, an input method editor (also called front end processor) or any other setting affecting input on the device(s) used.  Using inputmode, the author can give hints to the agent that make form input easier for the user. Authors should provide inputmode attributes wherever possible, making sure that the values used cover a wide range of devices. The value of the inputmode attribute is a white space separated list of tokens. Tokens are either sequences of alphabetic letters or absolute URIs. The later can be distinguished from the former by noting that absolute URIs contain a ':'. Tokens are case-insensitive. All the tokens consisting of alphabetic letters only are defined in this specification, in E.3 List of Tokens (or a successor of this specification). This specification does not define any URIs for use as tokens, but allows others to define such URIs for extensibility. This may become necessary for devices with input modes that cannot be covered by the tokens provided here. The URI should dereference to a human-readable description of the input mode associated with the use of the URI as a token. This description should describe the input mode indicated by this token, and whether and how this token modifies other tokens or is modified by other tokens. Upon entering an empty form control with an inputmode attribute, the user agent should select the input mode indicated by the inputmode attribute value. User agents should not use the inputmode attribute to set the input mode when entering a form control with text already present. To set the appropriate input mode when entering a form control that already contains text, user agents should rely on platform-specific conventions. User agents should make available all the input modes which are supported by the (operating) system/device(s) they run on/have access to, and which are installed for regular use by the user. This is typically only a small subset of the input modes that can be described with the tokens defined here. Additional guidelines for user agent implementation are found at [UAAG 1.0].  The following simple algorithm is used to define how user agents match the values of an inputmode attribute to the input modes they can provide. This algorithm does not have to be implemented directly; user agents just have to behave as if they used it. The algorithm is not designed to produce "obvious" or "desirable" results for every possible combination of tokens, but to produce correct behavior for frequent token combinations and predictable behavior in all cases. First, each of the input modes available is represented by one or more lists of tokens. An input mode may correspond to more than one list of tokens; as an example, on a system set up for a Greek user, both "greek upperCase" and "user upperCase" would correspond to the same input mode. No two lists will be the same. Second, the inputmode attribute is scanned from front to back. For each token t in the inputmode attribute, if in the remaining list of tokens representing available input modes there is any list of tokens that contains t, then all lists of tokens representing available input modes that do not contain t are removed. If there is no remaining list of tokens that contains t, then t is ignored. Third, if one or more lists of tokens are left, and they all correspond to the same input mode, then this input mode is chosen. If no list is left (meaning that there was none at the start) or if the remaining lists correspond to more than one input mode, then no input mode is chosen. Example: Assume the list of lists of tokens representing the available input modes is: {"cyrillic upperCase", "cyrillic lowerCase", "cyrillic", "latin", "user upperCase", "user lowerCase"}, then the following inputmode values select the following input modes: "cyrillic title" selects "cyrillic", "cyrillic lowerCase" selects "cyrillic lowerCase", "lowerCase cyrillic" selects "cyrillic lowerCase", "latin upperCase" selects "latin", but "upperCase latin" does select "cyrillic upperCase" or "user upperCase" if they correspond to the same input mode, and does not select any input mode if "cyrillic upperCase" and "user upperCase" do not correspond to the same input mode. Tokens defined in this specification are separated into two categories: Script tokens and modifiers. In inputmode attributes, script tokens should always be listed before modifiers.

Traditional PC keyboards do not need most modifier tokens (indeed, users on such devices would be quite confused if the software decided to change case on its own; CAPS lock for upperCase may be an exception). However, modifier tokens can be very helpful to set input modes for small devices. User agents may use information available in an XML Schema pattern facet to set the input mode. Note that a pattern facet is a hard restriction on the lexical value of an instance data node, and can specify different restrictions for different parts of the data item. Attribute inputmode is a soft hint about the kinds of characters that the user may most probably start to input into the form control. Attribute inputmode is provided in addition to pattern facets for the following reasons: The set of allowable characters specified in a pattern may be so wide that it is not possible to deduce a reasonable input mode setting. Nevertheless, there frequently is a kind of characters that will be input by the user with high probability. In such a case, inputmode allows to set the input mode for the user's convenience. In some cases, it would be possible to derive the input mode setting from the pattern because the set of characters allowed in the pattern closely corresponds to a set of characters covered by an inputmode attribute value. However, such a derivation would require a lot of data and calculations on the user agent. Small devices may leave the checking of patterns to the server, but will easily be able to switch to those input modes that they support. Being able to make data entry for the user easier is of particular importance on small devices. This is an example of  the user interface markup for  a form for user input in Japanese. . This informative section provides a broad outline of new and existing CSS features needed to style XForms content. A future Recommendation from the CSS Working Group will fully develop the specification of these features. A CSS pseudo-class is used to select elements for styling based on information that lies outside of the document tree or that cannot be expressed using the other selectors. This list is not exhaustive; other pseudo-classes may be defined. Pseudo-elements are abstractions about the document tree beyond those specified by the document language. Pseudo-elements do not appear in the DOM; they are used only for purposes of styling. This list is not exhaustive; other pseudo-elements may be defined.  This section presents complete XForms examples. These and additional examples are maintained at http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/2002/Examples. Schema file payschema.xsd: Initial instance file bookmarks.xml: The following example shows one possible way of integrating XForms with [SVG 1.1]. Note that the complete set of rules for integrating XForms and SVG are not fully specified at the time this specification was published. Future versions of the XForms, SVG, or other W3C specifications might define more complete rules for integrating XForms and SVG which might not be compatible with the example below. Note that the example below does not use SVG's switch and requiredExtensions features, which are commonly used in conjunction with foreignObject. This document was produced with the participation of Forms Working Group participants, including: This document was encoded in the XMLspec DTD v2.6. The XML sources were transformed using diffspec and xmlspec stylesheets, version 2.6. The XML Schema portion of the Appendix was rendered into HTML with the xmlverbatim XSLT stylesheet (used with permission). The primary tool used for editing was XMLSpy. The XML was transformed using the XSLT processor in Java 6. The editor(s) use the W3C CVS repository and the W3C IRC server for collaborative authoring.

Boyer, IBM An introduction to XForms. The introduction outlines the design principles and includes a brief tutorial on XForms.  XForms reference manual. The bulk of the reference manual consists of the specification of XForms. This reference defines XForms and how XForms Processors must interpret the various components in order to claim conformance.  Appendixes contain an XML Schema description of XForms, references, examples, and other useful information.  Reference - linked to from above. Submitted data is strongly typed and can be checked using off-the-shelf tools. This speeds up form filling since it reduces the need for round trips to the server for validation. This obviates the need for custom server-side logic to marshal the submitted data to the application back-end. The received XML instance document can be directly validated and processed by the application back-end. This obviates duplication, and ensures that updating the validation rules as a result of a change in the underlying business logic does not require re-authoring validation constraints within the XForms application. This enables the XForms author to go beyond the basic set of constraints available from the back-end. Providing such additional constraints as part of the XForms Model enhances the overall usability of the resulting Web application. Using XML 1.0 for instance data ensures that the submitted data is internationalization ready. XForms separates content and presentation. User interface controls encapsulate all relevant metadata such as labels, thereby enhancing accessibility of the application when using different modalities. XForms user interface controls are generic and suited for device-independence. The high-level nature of the user interface controls, and the consequent intent-based authoring of the user interface makes it possible to re-target the user interaction to different devices. By defining XML-based declarative event handlers that cover common use cases, the majority of XForms documents can be statically analyzed, reducing the need for imperative scripts for event handlers. Foreign attributes are allowed on all XForms elements. The author-optional id attribute of type xsd:ID assigns an identity to the containing element. Binding expression interpreted as XPath. This attribute has no meaning when a bind attribute is present. Author-optional XForms Model selector. Specifies the ID of an XForms Model to be associated with this binding element. This attribute has no meaning for the current binding element when a bind attribute is present. Rules for determining the context XForms Model are located at 7.2 Evaluation Context. Author-optional  reference to a bind element. Binding expression interpreted as XPath. This attribute has no meaning when a bind attribute is present. Author-optional reference to a bind element. Author-optional space-separated list of XPath extension functions (represented by QNames) required by this XForms Model. Guidance on the use of this attribute is at 7.12 Extension Functions. Author-optional link to externally defined initial instance data. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-link-exception Event). Author-optional link to externally defined initial instance data. If the link is traversed and the traversal fails, it is treated as an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-link-exception Event). Author-optional attribute to define an appearance hint. If absent, the user agent may freely choose any suitable rendering. This author-optional attribute is a non-negative integer in the range of 0-32767 used to define the navigation sequence. This gives the author control over the sequence in which form controls are traversed. The default navigation order is specified in the chapter 4 Processing Model. This author-optional attribute defines a shortcut for moving the input focus directly to a particular form control. The value of this is a single character which when pressed together with a platform specific modifier key (e.g., the alt key) results in the focus being set to this form control.The user agent must provide a means of identifying the accesskeys that can be used in a presentation. This may be accomplished in different ways by different implementations, for example through direct interaction with the application or via the user's guide. The accesskey requested by the author might not be made available by the player (for example it may not exist on the device used, or it may be used by the player itself). Therefore the user agent should make the specified key available, but may map the accesskey to a different interaction behavior. Author-optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Author-optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Author-optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. This form control does not use the UI Common attribute group, but nevertheless still contains an author-optional appearance attribute, as defined above. Author-optional. Space-separated list of suggested media types, used by the XForms Processor to determine the possible sources of data to upload.  Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is false. Author-optional attribute containing a  hint for the lexical starting bound for the range&mdash;a legal value for the underlying data. If provided, this value is used to further refine the constraints specified by the underlying model. Author-optional attribute containing a  hint for the ending bound for the range&mdash;a legal value for the underlying data. If provided, this value is used to further refine the constraints specified by the underlying model. Author-optional attribute containing a delta-value to use for incrementing or decrementing the value. Must be of a type capable of expressing the difference between two legal values of the underlying data. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is false. Author-optional attribute determining whether free entry is allowed in the list. Default is "closed". Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is true. Author-optional attribute determining whether free entry is allowed in the list. Default is "closed". Author-optional. When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is true. Author-optional selection status for the case. The default value is "false". Author-optional 1-based initial value of the repeat index. The default value is 1. Author-optional hint to the XForms Processor as to how many elements from the collection to display.  Author-optional attribute defined in Section 10.17 Conditional Execution of XForms Actions. Author-optional attribute defined in Section 10.18 Iteration of XForms Actions. Required reference to a repeating element. Author-optional attribute for specifying the  name of the event to dispatch. Author-optional attribute for specifying the  reference to the event target.   Author-optional attribute containing a  boolean indicating if this event bubbles&mdash;as defined in [DOM2 Events]. The default value  is true for a custom event. For predefined events, this attribute has no effect. Author-optional attribute containing a  boolean indicating if this event is cancelable&mdash;as defined in [DOM2 Events]. The default value  is true for a custom event. For predefined events, this attribute has no effect. Author-optional attribute. Link to an external resource to load. Author-optional link behavior specifier. The allowed values are "replace" and "new". If this attribute is missing, a default value of "replace" is assumed. The document is loaded into a new presentation context, e.g., a new window. Form processing in the original window continues. The document is loaded into the current window. Form processing is interrupted, exactly as if the user had manually requested navigating to a new document. Author-optional selector binding expression enabling submission of a portion of the instance data. The selected node, and all descendants, are selected for submission. The default value is "/". Author-optional reference to a bind element. When present, the binding reference on this attribute is used in preference to any binding reference from the ref attribute. Author-optional boolean attribute that indicates whether or not the data validation checks of the submission are performed. The default value is "false" if the value of serialization is "none" and "true" otherwise. Author-optional boolean attribute that indicates whether or not the relevance pruning of the submission is performed. The default value is "false" if the value of serialization is "none" and "true" otherwise. Author-optional attribute specifying the version of XML to be serialized. The default is "1.0". Author-optional attribute specifying whether the serializer should add extra white space nodes for readability. The default is "false". Author-optional attribute specifying the mediatype for XML  serialization  of instance data. Authors should ensure that the type specified is compatible with the data being submitted, such as application/xml for posted XML data. The default is "application/xml".Note:This attribute does not affect serialization and cannot be used to override the serialization attribute.  It is only used to provide additional information about the submission data serialization when the serialization is application/xml.  For example, this attribute could be used to indicate that the content type of the XML serialization is text/xml. Author-optional attribute specifying an encoding for serialization. The default is "UTF-8". Author-optional attribute specifying whether to omit the XML declaration on the serialized instance data. The default value is "false". Author-optional attribute specifying whether to include a standalone declaration in the serialized XML.If the omit-xml-declaration attribute has the value true, then this attribute is ignored.  Otherwise, if this attribute is omitted, then the XML declaration does not include a standalone document declaration, and if this attribute is specified, then the XML declaration includes a standalone document declaration with the same value as this attribute. Author-optional attribute specifying element names to be serialized with CDATA sections. The default is empty string. Author-optional attribute providing control over namespace serialization. If absent, all namespace nodes present in the instance data are considered for serialization. If present, specifies list of namespace prefixes to consider for serialization, in addition to those visibly utilized. As in [Exc-C14N], the special value #default specifies the default namespace.

Access to SOAP-based web services, RESTful services, ATOM-based services, and non-XML services Improved control over submission processing and serialization Ability to control the submission URI and headers with instance data Targetted instance data replacement capabilities working with tabular data and parallel lists: current(), choose() and context()  basic security capabilities: digest(), hmac(), and random() improved numeric and string processing: power(), is-card-number(), and compare() search across instances of a model: two parameter id() function access to context information added to many XForms events: event() The user interface is not hard-coded to use radio buttons. Different devices (such as voice browsers) can render the concept of "select one" as appropriate. Core form controls always have labels directly associated with them as child elements&mdash; this is a key feature designed to enhance accessibility. There is no need for an enclosing form element, as in HTML. (See 2.4 Multiple Forms per Document for details on how to author multiple forms per document) Markup for specifying form controls has been simplified in comparison with HTML forms. There is complete flexibility in the structure of the XML instance data, including the use of attributes. Notice that XML namespaces are used, and that a wrapper element of the author's choosing contains the instance data. Empty elements number and expiry serve as place-holders in the XML structure, and will be filled in with form data provided by the user. An initial value ("cc") for the form control is provided through the instance data, in this case an attribute method. In the submitted XML, this initial value will be replaced by the user input, if the user changes the form control displaying that data. Initialization Interaction Notification Error Conditions All XML Schemas are loaded. If an error occurs while attempting to access or process a remote document, processing halts with an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-link-exception Event). If applicable, P3P initialization occurs. [P3P 1.0] The single node  binding expression is evaluated, if it exists on the form control,  to ensure that it points to a node that exists. If this is not the case then the form control should behave in the same manner as if it had bound to a model item with the relevant model item property resolved to false. Otherwise, the user interface for the form control is created and initialized. For the first reference to an instance a default instance is created by following the rules described below.A root instanceData element is created. An instance data element node will be created using the binding expression from the user interface control as the name. If the name is not a valid QName, processing halts with an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event).  For the second and subsequent references to an instance which was automatically created the following processing is performed:If a matching instance data node is found, the user interface control will be connected to that element. If a matching instance data node is not found, an instance data node will be created using the binding expression from the user interface control as the name. If the name is not a valid QName, processing halts with an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event).  For each node in the selected XPath node-set, any child bind elements are recursively processed as described in the three points of this list. the constraint model item property is true the value is non-empty if the required model item property is true All UI Expressions  are   reevaluated  (implementations may optimize this operation but must behave as if all UI Expressions are reevaluated). current values (for the appropriate form controls and related UI elements) validity the proper number of and content for repeat objects. Form controls that have a navindex specified and assign a positive value to it are navigated first.Outermost form controls are navigated in increasing order of the navindex value. Values need not be sequential nor must they begin with any particular value. Form controls that have identical navindex values are to be navigated in document order. Ancestor form controls (&lt;group&gt;, &lt;repeat&gt;, and &lt;switch&gt;) establish a local navigation sequence. All form controls within a local sequence are navigated, in increasing order of the navindex value, before any outside the local sequence are navigated. Form controls that have identical navindex values are navigated in document order.  Those form controls that do not specify navindex or supply a value of "0" are navigated next. These form controls are navigated in document order. Those form controls that are disabled, hidden, or not relevant are assigned a relative order in the overall sequence but do not participate as navigable controls.  The navigation sequence past the last form control (or before the first) is undefined. XForms Processors may cycle back to the first/last control, remove focus from the form, or other possibilities. When the form control is interactively changed, and has the incremental="true" setting, the event sequence described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change may be initiated at implementation dependent intervals. When the form control is interactively changed and does not have the incremental="true" setting, no events are required to be dispatched, and thus no order is defined. When the user activates the control and the value has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node, the event sequence consists of the events described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change followed by dispatching the DOMActivate event.  See 8.1.2 The input Element for an example. When focus changes from the form control and the value has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node,  the event sequence is as described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change. The implementation of an output dispatches xforms-output-error if it unable to process the output data (such as corrupt image data when the output mediatype indicates it is image data).  This event may occur each time the output is given new data (such as a change of data in the bound data node or a change of the bound data node). When a selection is interactively changed, and the select or select1 form control has the incremental="false" setting, the event sequence is described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change. When the user activates the control and the selection has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node, the event sequence consists of the events described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change followed by dispatching the DOMActivate event.  Note that this event sequence will have been preceded by the event sequence described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change at the moment the selection was changed. When focus changes from the form control and the selection has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node,   the event sequence is as described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change.  Note that this event sequence will have been preceded by the event sequence described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change at the moment the selection was changed. Activating the form control causes the event sequence defined at 4.6.8 Sequence: Activating a Trigger. Activating the form control causes the event sequence defined at 4.6.8 Sequence: Activating a Trigger, followed immediately by the event sequence defined at 4.6.9 Sequence: Submission. xforms-deselect (for each item deselected by the change, if any) xforms-select (for each item selected by the change, if any) xforms-recalculate xforms-revalidate [n] xforms-value-changed [n] xforms-valid or xforms-invalid [n] xforms-enabled or xforms-disabled [n] xforms-optional or xforms-required [n] xforms-readonly or xforms-readwrite [n] xforms-out-of-range or xforms-in-range Perform further deferred updates as necessary DOMActivate xforms-submit xforms-submit-serialize xforms-submit-done or xforms-submit-error Fixed properties are static values that the XForms Processor evaluates only once. Such properties consist of literals, and are not subject to XPath evaluation. Computed expressions are XPath expressions that provide a value to the XForms Processor. Such values are recalculated at certain times as specified by the XForms Processing Model (see 4 Processing Model). These expressions encode dynamic properties, often constraints, such as the dependency among various data items. Computed expressions are not restricted to examining the value of the instance data node to which they apply. XPath expressions provide the means to traverse the instance data; more complex computations may be encoded as call-outs to external scripts. Applicable XML schema definitions (including those associated an external or an inline schema, or by xsi:type) An XForms type constraint associated with the instance data node using XForms binding. If no type constraint is provided, the instance data node defaults to type="xsd:string" (default to string rule). No variable bindings are in place.   The available function library is defined below in 7.5 The XForms Function Library.   Any namespace declarations in scope for the attribute that defines the expression are applied to the expression.  The context node, position and size are determined according to rules described below. A binding element is "outermost" if the element has no ancestor binding elements. If an outermost binding element is contained by a model, then the context node for the outermost binding element is the top-level document element node of the default instance of the containing model element. Otherwise, the context node for outermost binding elements is the top-level document element node of the default instance in the default model.  For outermost binding elements, the context size and position are 1.  The context node, position and size for non-outermost binding elements is determined using  the binding expression attribute or in-scope evaluation context  of the  nearest ancestor binding element.  This is also referred to as "scoped resolution". For a non-outermost binding element:If the nearest ancestor binding element is not a bound element, then the in-scope evaluation context of the non-outermost binding element is equivalent to the in-scope evaluation context of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Single-Node binding, then the in-scope evaluation context of the non-outermost binding element has a context size and position of 1 and the context node is the one resulting from the Single-Node binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Node Set binding, then the XForms processor dynamically generates an occurrence of the non-outermost binding element for each of the nodes in the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element.  The dynamic in-scope evaluation context for each generated occurrence of the non-outermost binding element has a context size equal to the size of the nodeset identified by the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element, the context node is the node for which the occurrence of the non-outermost binding element was generated, and the position is equal to the position of the generator node in the nodeset identified by the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Node Set binding, then the non-outermost binding element has its own in-scope evaluation context separately from those of its dynamically generated occurences described above.  The in-scope evaluation context has a context position of 1, and the context node and size are set by the first node and the size of the nodeset identified by the Node Set binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. Once the context node of the in-scope evaluation context has been determined according to the rules above, if the binding element expresses a model attribute that refers to a model other than the one containing the context node, then the context node of the in-scope evaluation context is changed to be the top-level document element node of the default instance of the referenced model, and the context position and size are changed to 1. All form controls, including container form controls, should have an inline layout by default (e.g. for a host language that supports CSS, the default styling should be display:inline).  By default, repeat items should have a block layout (e.g. a default styling of display:block for host languages that support CSS). If a form control violates its data binding restriction, an xforms-binding-exception must occur.Note:Form controls that read or write simpleContent produce this exception whenever and as soon as they are bound to an element node that has an element child node. Form controls that write simpleContent to instance data must do so exactly as defined by the XForms Action setvalue (10.2 The setvalue Element).Note:If a form control binds to an element node, then regardless of how many child nodes the element has, the result of the form control writing to the bound element node is that it has either a single non-empty text node child, or no children if the simpleContent written is the empty string (which is in accord with the data model of [XPath 1.0]). Attribute nodes: returns the string-value of the node. Text nodes: returns the string-value of the node. Namespace, processing instruction, and comment nodes: behavior is undefined (implementation-dependent). the XPath root node: an xforms-binding-exception occurs. the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to empty nodeset, the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to a non-relevant instance node, the form control is contained by a non-relevant switch or group (which includes a non-relevant repeat item), or the form control is contained by a non-selected case element of a switch. Except as noted, relevant form controls must distinguish rendering between being bound to a required node versus a non-required node. Exceptions are form controls that do not directly render the string value of the bound node (including trigger and the container form controls).  Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. Relevant  form controls must distinguish rendering between valid and invalid states. Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. Relevant  form controls must indicate when the bound instance data contains a value or content that  the form control is not capable of rendering. Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. If a form control binds to a readonly node, then the form control must not allow the user to modify the node value.  The relevant form control that is bound to a readonly node  should render in a way which indicates that entering or changing the value is not allowed. Control of the render behavior should be made available to stylesheets. If the instance node either is of type or is derived from type xsd:base64Binary, then the data is base-64 decoded. If the instance node either is of type or is derived from type xsd:hexBinary, then the data is hex-binary decoded. If the instance node either is of type or is derived from type xsd:anyURI, then the data is treated as a URI and dereferenced. If the instance node is of any other type, then the data is used without modification. Data to be decoded does not conform to the format of xsd:base64Binary or xsd:hexBinary An error dereferencing the URI in a node of or derived from type xsd:anyURI A data format error (e.g. invalid or unsupported image format) An unrecognized media type identifier string When bound to an instance data node of type xsd:base64binary, xsd:hexBinary, or a type derived by restriction thereof, on activation upload places the binary content in the content of the node with the indicated encoding. When bound to an instance data node of type xsd:anyURI (or a type derived by restriction thereof), on activation upload places a URI in the content of the node.For security reasons, the XForms Processor must not dereference the URI bound to this form control without explicit user permission.Note:Implementors note that upload must associate the binary content, mediatype, and filename with that URI for 11.9.6 Serialization as multipart/related and 11.9.7 Serialization as multipart/form-data serialization.  Implementations with a file system should support file upload&mdash;selecting a specific file. The types of files presented by default should reflect the mediatype specified by attribute mediatype, for example defaulting to only audio file types in the file dialog when the mediatype is "audio/*".  Implementations with specific pen/digitizer hardware should (and implementations with other pointing devices may) support scribble&mdash;allowing in-place creation of pen-based data.  Implementations with specific audio recording capabilities should support record audio&mdash;in-place recording of an audio clip.  Implementations with a digital camera, scanner interface or screen capture should support acquire image&mdash;in-place upload of images from an attached device.  Implementations with video recording capability should provide a record video option.  Implementations with 3d capabilities should provide a 3d interface option. Implementations may provide proprietary implementations (for example, a mediatype of text/rtf could invoke an edit window with a proprietary word processing application) Implementations are encouraged to support other input devices not mentioned here. Implementations which cannot support upload for the given mediatype must make this apparent to the user. On activation, if child element filename is present and a filename is available, upload places the filename of the data to upload in the instance at the node indicated by the binding attributes on child element filename. On activation, if child element mediatype is present and a mediatype is available, upload places the mediatype of the data to upload in the instance at the node indicated by the binding attributes on child element mediatype.  Factoring all human readable messages to a separate resource XML file. Using URIs into this XML resource bundle within individual label elements Finally, an XForms implementation could use content negotiation to obtain the appropriate XML resource bundle, e.g., based on the accept-language headers from the client, to serve up the user interface with messages localized to the client's locale. the value of a node indicated by a single node binding expression, if specified the result of evaluating an XPath expression appearing in attribute value, if specified the inline content of the value element (when neither the single node binding nor the value attribute are expressed). the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to empty nodeset, the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to a non-relevant instance node, the group is contained by a non-relevant switch or group (which includes a non-relevant repeat object), or the group is contained by a non-selected case element of a switch. The Node Set Binding is evaluated to locate the  repeat collection  to be operated on by this repeat.  The index for this repeating structure is initialized to the value of startindex. If the initial startindex is less than 1 it defaults to 1. If the index is greater than the initial node-set then it defaults to the size of the node-set.  User interface as specified by the repeat is generated for the requisite number of members of the collection as specified by attributes on element repeat.  An insert action can add one or more nodes that match the repeat nodeset; The new instance data subtree created by a submission instance replacement may contain nodes that match the repeat nodeset; A setvalue action or a calculate may change a value that causes one or more nodes to match the repeat nodeset. A delete action can remove nodes that matched the repeat nodeset; The new instance data subtree created by a submission instance replacement may replace nodes that matched the repeat nodeset; A setvalue action or a calculate may change a value that causes one or more nodes to stop matching the repeat nodeset. The target node, selected by the binding attributes on the list form control, must be an element node, otherwise an exception results (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). The element node associated with the item, selected by the binding attributes on copy, is deep copied as a child of the target node  by using  an insert action  (10.3 The insert Element). A full computational dependency rebuild is done, followed by recalculate, revalidate, and refresh. The target node, selected by the binding attributes on the list form control, must be an element node, otherwise an exception results (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). The child element node associated with the item, selected by the binding attributes on copy, is deleted  by using  a delete action  (10.4 The delete Element). A full computational dependency rebuild, followed by recalculate, revalidate, and refresh. Attribute nodes: The string-value of the attribute is replaced with a string corresponding to the new value. Text nodes: The text node is replaced with a new one corresponding to the new value, or the text node is eliminated if the new value is the empty string. Namespace, processing instruction, and comment nodes: behavior is undefined (implementation-dependent). the XPath root node: an xforms-binding-exception occurs. The XForms action system's deferred update flags for rebuild, recalculate, revalidate and refresh are set. Dispatches an xforms-deselect event to the currently selected case  in the switch containing the identified case. Adjusts the selected states (not the attribute values) on the affected cases to reflect the new state of the switch containing the identified case. Dispatches an xform-select event to the case just selected. Predefined XForms events (i.e., xforms-event-name), in which case the bubbles and cancelable attributes are ignored and the standard semantics as defined in 4 Processing Model apply. An event created by the XForms author with no predefined XForms semantics and as such not handled by default by the XForms Processor. The submission method is determined. The submission resource is determined. If the resource is not specified, then submission processing stops after dispatching even xforms-submit-error with context information containing an error-type of resource-error. Behaviors of other possible values for attribute replace are not defined in this specification. document order of header elements node order of nodes in nodeset attribute document order of value elements the submission resource the submission method the header elements The submit URI is examined. If it does not already contain a ? (question mark) character, one is appended. If it does already contain a question mark character and the serialized form data is non-empty, then a separator character from the attribute separator is appended. The serialized form data, if any,  is appended to the URI. An XML document is produced following the rules of the XML output method defined in [XSLT 1.0] section 16 and 16.1, using the values supplied as attributes of the submission element.Handling of namespace nodes: The default behavior is that every namespace node is serialized according to the rules of the XML output method, so that at least one namespace declaration appears in the serialized XML for each in-scope namespace. Additional inherited namespaces are declared on the root element of the serialized XML. If, however, attribute includenamespaceprefixes on element submission is present, then all namespace declarations not visibly utilized in the instance data (as defined in [Exc-C14N]) and the default namespace if it is empty are excluded from the root element serialization, unless the corresponding namespace prefix is listed in the includenamespaceprefixes attribute. The special value #default represents the default namespace.  Mediatype: By default, the mediatype of the serialized XML instance is application/xml, but can be changed to a compatible type using element submission attribute mediatype. Authors should ensure that the type specified is compatible with application/xml. multipart/related message header requirements:Must contain a type parameter of the mediatype of the serialized XML instance. Must contain a start parameter referring to the Content-ID first body part (root). First body part (root) requirements:Must have Content-Type parameter of the type specified by the submission mediatype attribute. Content is serialized by the rules at 11.9.5 Serialization as application/xml. Subsequent part requirements:One part for each node with a datatype of xsd:anyURI populated by upload with:A Content-Type header that represents the type of the attachment if known, otherwise application/octet-stream. A Content-Transfer-Encoding header. A Content-ID header whose value matches the URI in the associated instance data node. The binary content associated with the URI, serialized according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding heading. Each element node is visited in document order, except non-relevant elements are skipped if the relevant setting of the submission is true. Each visited element that has no child element nodes (i.e., each leaf element node) is selected for inclusion, including those that have no value (no text node). Element nodes selected for inclusion are  encoded as Content-Disposition: form-data MIME parts as defined in [RFC 2388], with the name parameter being the element local name. Element nodes of any datatype populated by upload also have a Content-Disposition filename parameter, if the filename is available.  Element nodes of any datatype not populated by upload are serialized as the string value of the element (the concatenation of all text node children, or empty string if the element has no text node children). The Content-Type must be text/plain except for xsd:anyURI, xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary, and derived types, in which case the header represents the media type of the attachment if known, otherwise application/octet-stream. If a character set is applicable, the Content-Type may have a charset parameter. Element nodes selected for inclusion are encoded as EltName=value, where = is a literal character, EltName represents the element local name, and value represents the string value of the element (the concatenation of all text node children, or empty string if the element has no text node children). The separator character {sep} from the separator attribute on submission is used between pairs of encoded name/value pairs, e.g. EltName1=value1{sep}EltName2=value2{sep}EltName3=value3. Note that contextual path information is not preserved, nor are namespaces or namespace prefixes. As a result, different elements might serialize to the same name.The encoding of EltName and value are as follows: space characters are replaced by +, and then non-ASCII and reserved characters (as defined by [RFC 2396] as amended by subsequent documents in the IETF track) are escaped by replacing the character with one or more octets of the UTF-8 representation of the character, with each octet in turn replaced by %HH, where HH represents the uppercase hexadecimal notation for the octet value and % is a literal character. Line breaks are represented as "CR LF" pairs (i.e., %0D%0A).  All such encodings are concatenated, maintaining document order. an empty nodeset a readonly node, if replace="text" a non-element, if replace="instance" a node whose parent is readonly, if replace="instance" If the submission mediatype contains a charset MIME parameter, then it is appended to the application/soap+xml MIME type. Otherwise, a charset MIME parameter with same value as the encoding attribute (or its default) is appended to the application/soap+xml MIME type. No other MIME parameters from the mediatype are copied to the application/soap+xml MIME type The q MIME parameter must not be specified in the application/soap+xml MIME type so that the default quality of 1 is used. if the action MIME parameter appears in the mediatype then a SOAPAction HTTP header is added and given a value equal to the content of the action MIME parameter [XML 1.0] [XML Names] [XPath 1.0] [XML Events] [XML Schema part 2] [XML 1.0] [XML Names] [XPath 1.0] [XML Events] (not all aspects are required) [XML Schema part 2] The processor may support the Extension module.  A master dependency directed graph is created as detailed in C.1 Details on Creating the Master Dependency Directed Graph. To provide consistent behavior, implementations must reduce the number of vertices to be processed by computing a pertinent dependency subgraph consisting only of vertices and edges that are reachable from nodes that require recomputation. This is detailed in C.2 Details on Creating the Pertinent Dependency Subgraph. Note that on a first recomputation (such as on form load), the pertinent dependency subgraph will be the same as the master dependency directed graph. A topological sort is performed on the vertices of the pertinent dependency subgraph, resulting in an order of evaluation in which each vertex is evaluated only after those vertices on which it depends and before all vertices which depend on it. The topological sort algorithm is discussed at [Algorithms]. The recalculate process completes. A vertex with inDegree of 0 is selected for evaluation and removed from the pertinent dependency subgraph. In the case where more than one vertex has inDegree zero, no particular ordering is specified. If the pertinent dependency subgraph contains vertices, but none have an inDegree of 0, then the calculation structure of the form has a loop, and an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event) must be thrown, terminating processing. If the vertex corresponds to a computed item, computed expressions are evaluated as follows:calculate: If the value of the model item changes, the corresponding instance data is updated and the dirty flag is set. relevant, readonly, required, constraint: If any or all of these computed properties change, the new settings are  placed into effect for associated form controls. For each vertex in the depList of the removed vertex, decrement the inDegree by 1. If no vertices remain in the pertinent dependency subgraph, then the calculation has successfully completed. Otherwise, repeat this sequence from step 1.

Nevertheless, there frequently is a kind of characters that will be input by the user with high probability. In such a case, inputmode allows to set the input mode for the user's convenience. In some cases, it would be possible to derive the input mode setting from the pattern because the set of characters allowed in the pattern closely corresponds to a set of characters covered by an inputmode attribute value. However, such a derivation would require a lot of data and calculations on the user agent. Small devices may leave the checking of patterns to the server, but will easily be able to switch to those input modes that they support. Being able to make data entry for the user easier is of particular importance on small devices. John M.

A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. Forms are an important part of the Web, and they continue to be the primary means for enabling interactive Web applications. Web applications and electronic commerce solutions have sparked the demand for better Web forms with richer interactions. XForms is the response to this demand, and provides a new platform-independent markup language for online interaction between a person (through an XForms Processor) and another, usually remote, agent. XForms are the successor to HTML forms, and benefit from the lessons learned from HTML forms.  Further background information on XForms can be found at http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms.  This specification has been written with various types of readers in mind&mdash;in particular XForms authors and XForms implementors. We hope the specification will provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient, attractive and accessible documents without overexposing them to the XForms implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all they need to build conforming XForms Processors. The specification begins with a general presentation of XForms before specifying the technical details of the various XForms components.  The specification has been written with various modes of presentation in mind. In case of a discrepancy, the online electronic version is considered the authoritative version of the document.  The specification is organized into the following chapters:  An introduction to XForms. The introduction outlines the design principles and includes a brief tutorial on XForms.  XForms reference manual. The bulk of the reference manual consists of the specification of XForms. This reference defines XForms and how XForms Processors must interpret the various components in order to claim conformance.  Appendixes contain an XML Schema description of XForms, references, examples, and other useful information.  Throughout this document, the following namespace prefixes and corresponding namespace identifiers are used:  xforms: The XForms namespace, e.g. http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms (see 3.1 Namespace for XForms)html: An XHTML namespace,  e.g. http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml (see [XHTML 1.0])xs: The XML Schema namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema (see [XML Schema part 1])xsd: The XML Schema namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema (see [XML Schema part 2])xsi: The XML Schema for instances namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance (see [XML Schema part 1])ev: The XML Events namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events (see [XML Events])my: Any user defined namespace This is only a convention; any namespace prefix may be used in practice.  The following typographical conventions are used to present technical material in this document.  The XML representations of various elements within XForms are presented using the syntax for Abstract Modules in XHTML Modularization [XHTML Modularization]. Examples are set off typographically: References to external documents appear as follows: [Sample Reference] with links to the references section of this document.  The following typesetting convention is used for additional commentary:  A gentle explanation to readers.   A specific issue for which input from implementors is requested, for example as part of the Candidate Recommendation phase.  None recorded. This informative section provides an overview of the new features and changed behaviors available in XForms 1.1. The model element now must support a version attribute to help authors bridge the transition between XForms 1.0 to XForms 1.1. The submission element offers many new features that allow significantly improved data communications capabilities for XForms, including: Access to SOAP-based web services, RESTful services, ATOM-based services, and non-XML services Improved control over submission processing and serialization Ability to control the submission URI and headers with instance data Targetted instance data replacement capabilities Finally, over a dozen new examples have been added to illustrate submission usage. XForms 1.1 now offers email and card-number datatypes so form authors can easily validate email address and credit card number input values. XForms 1.1 now contains many new functions that can be used in calculate and other XPath expressions to enable numerous features, including: working with tabular data and parallel lists: current(), choose() and context()  basic security capabilities: digest(), hmac(), and random() improved numeric and string processing: power(), is-card-number(), and compare() search across instances of a model: two parameter id() function access to context information added to many XForms events: event() The behavioral description common to all form controls has been improved to indicate default layout styling and rendering requirements for required data. The output form control has been improved to render non-text mediatypes, particularly images, obtained from instance data. The ability to create wizard-like interfaces with dynamically available form controls has been improved.  Details are in the description of improvements to actions. XForms has been designed on the basis of several years' experience with HTML forms. HTML forms have formed the backbone of the e-commerce revolution, and having shown their worth, have also indicated numerous ways they could be improved. The primary difference when comparing XForms with HTML forms, apart from XForms being in XML, is the separation of the data being collected from the markup of the controls collecting the individual values. By doing this, it not only makes XForms more tractable by making it clear what is being submitted where, it also eases reuse of forms, since the underlying essential part of a Form is no longer irretrievably bound to the page it is used in. A second major difference is that XForms, while designed to be integrated into XHTML, is no longer restricted only to be a part of that language, but may be integrated into any suitable markup language. XForms has striven to improve authoring, reuse, internationalization, accessibility, usability, and device independence. Here is a summary of the primary benefits of using XForms: Submitted data is strongly typed and can be checked using off-the-shelf tools. This speeds up form filling since it reduces the need for round trips to the server for validation. This obviates the need for custom server-side logic to marshal the submitted data to the application back-end. The received XML instance document can be directly validated and processed by the application back-end. This obviates duplication, and ensures that updating the validation rules as a result of a change in the underlying business logic does not require re-authoring validation constraints within the XForms application. This enables the XForms author to go beyond the basic set of constraints available from the back-end. Providing such additional constraints as part of the XForms Model enhances the overall usability of the resulting Web application. Using XML 1.0 for instance data ensures that the submitted data is internationalization ready. XForms separates content and presentation. User interface controls encapsulate all relevant metadata such as labels, thereby enhancing accessibility of the application when using different modalities. XForms user interface controls are generic and suited for device-independence. The high-level nature of the user interface controls, and the consequent intent-based authoring of the user interface makes it possible to re-target the user interaction to different devices. By defining XML-based declarative event handlers that cover common use cases, the majority of XForms documents can be statically analyzed, reducing the need for imperative scripts for event handlers. In the XForms approach, forms are comprised of a section that describes what the form does, called the XForms Model, and another section that describes how the form is to be presented.  Consider a simple electronic commerce form that might be rendered as follows: It is clear that we are collecting a value that represents whether cash or a credit card is being used, and if a credit card, its number and expiration date. This can be represented in the XForms model element, which in XHTML would typically be contained within the head section:  This simply says that we are collecting three pieces of information (note that we have as yet not said anything about their types), and that they will be submitted using the URL in the action attribute. XForms defines a device-neutral, platform-independent set of form controls suitable for general-purpose use. The controls are bound to the XForms Model via the XForms binding mechanism, in this simple case using the ref attribute on the controls. In XHTML, this markup would typically appear within the body section (note that we have intentionally defaulted the XForms namespace prefix here): Notice the following features of this design: The user interface is not hard-coded to use radio buttons. Different devices (such as voice browsers) can render the concept of "select one" as appropriate. Core form controls always have labels directly associated with them as child elements&mdash; this is a key feature designed to enhance accessibility. There is no need for an enclosing form element, as in HTML. (See 2.4 Multiple Forms per Document for details on how to author multiple forms per document) Markup for specifying form controls has been simplified in comparison with HTML forms.  The fact that you can bind form controls to the model like this simplifies integrating XForms into other host languages, since any form control markup may be used to bind to the model. The XForms Processor can directly submit the data collected as XML. In the example, the submitted data would look like this: XForms processing keeps track of the state of the partially filled form through this instance data. Initial values for the instance data may be provided or left empty as in the example. Element instance essentially holds a skeleton XML document that gets updated as the user fills out the form. It gives the author full control on the structure of the submitted XML data, including namespace information. When the form is submitted, the instance data is serialized as an XML document. Here is an alternative version of the earlier example: In this case the submitted data would look like this: This design has features worth calling out: There is complete flexibility in the structure of the XML instance data, including the use of attributes. Notice that XML namespaces are used, and that a wrapper element of the author's choosing contains the instance data. Empty elements number and expiry serve as place-holders in the XML structure, and will be filled in with form data provided by the user. An initial value ("cc") for the form control is provided through the instance data, in this case an attribute method. In the submitted XML, this initial value will be replaced by the user input, if the user changes the form control displaying that data. To connect this instance data with form controls, the ref attributes on the form controls need to be changed to point to the proper part of the instance data, using binding expressions: Binding expressions are based on XPath [XPath 1.0], including the use of the @ character to refer to attributes, as seen here. Note that for illustrative purposes, the first two expressions make use of the XPath context node, which defaults to the top-level element (here my:payment). The third expression shows an absolute path. XForms allows data to be checked for validity as the form is being filled. In the absence of specific information about the types of values being collected, all values are returned as strings, but it is possible to assign types to values in the instance data. In this example, number should accept digits only, and should have between 14 and 18 digits and expiry should accept only valid month/date combinations. Furthermore, the credit card information form controls for number and expiry are only relevant if the "cc" option is chosen for method, but are required in that case. By specifying an additional component, model item properties, authors can include rich declarative validation information in forms. Such information can be taken from XML Schemas as well as XForms-specific additions, such as relevant. Such properties appear on bind elements, while Schema constraints are expressed in an XML Schema fragment, either inline or external. For example:  In the above example, the relevant expression uses absolute XPath notation (beginning with /) because the evaluation context nodes for computed expressions are determined by the binding expression (see 7.2 Evaluation Context), and so any relative node path in the first bind relevant above would be relative to /my:payment/my:number XForms processing places no limits on the number of individual forms that can be placed in a single containing document. When a single document contains multiple forms, each form needs a separate model element, each with an id attribute so that they can be referenced from elsewhere in the containing document. In addition, form controls should specify which model element contains the instance data to which they bind. This is accomplished through a model attribute that is part of the binding attributes. If no model attribute is specified on the binding element, the nearest ancestor binding element's model attribute is used, and failing that, the first XForms Model in document order is used. This technique is called 'scoped resolution', and is used frequently in XForms. The next example adds an opinion poll to our electronic commerce form. Additionally, the following markup would appear in the body section of the document: The main difference here is the use of model="poll", which identifies the instance. Note that submit refers to the submission element by ID and does not require binding attributes.  More XForms examples can be found in H Complete XForms Examples. XForms is an application of XML [XML 1.0] and has been designed for use within other XML vocabularies&mdash;in particular within a future version of XHTML [XHTML 1.0]. XForms always requires such a host language. This chapter discusses the structure of XForms that allow XForms to be used with other document types. The namespace URI for XForms is http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms. The XForms schema has the target namespace specified and as such is compatible with the XForms 1.0 definition.  The Common Attribute Collection applies to every element in the XForms namespace. Foreign attributes are allowed on all XForms elements. The author-optional id attribute of type xsd:ID assigns an identity to the containing element. Elements can be identified using any attribute of type ID (such as xml:id), not just the id attribute defined above. Section 3.3.2 The instance Element defines attribute src for the instance element.  Binding expression interpreted as XPath. This attribute has no meaning when a bind attribute is present. Author-optional XForms Model selector. Specifies the ID of an XForms Model to be associated with this binding element. This attribute has no meaning for the current binding element when a bind attribute is present. Rules for determining the context XForms Model are located at 7.2 Evaluation Context. Author-optional  reference to a bind element. In this specification, when an XForms element is declared to have a Single-Node Binding, then the author must specify the  Single-Node Binding  unless the element explicitly states that it is author-optional.  In some cases, an XForms element may allow a Single-Node Binding, but one or more attributes in the Single-Node Binding attribute group are inappropriate for that XForms element.  In such cases, the exact attributes are listed for the XForms element, but those attributes still express a Single-Node Binding if they appear in the element.  For example, the submission element forbids the model attribute because the model is defined to be the one containing the submission, so the attributes ref and bind are listed for submission rather than referring to the Single-Node Binding attribute group, but if a ref or bind attribute is used on a submission, it does express a Single-Node Binding.  First-node rule: When a Single-Node Binding attribute selects a node-set of size &gt; 1, the first node in the node-set, based on document order, is used. It is an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event) if the XForms Processor encounters a model  attribute  IDREF value that refers to an ID not on a model element, or a bind  attribute  IDREF value that refers to an ID not on a bind element. Binding expression interpreted as XPath. This attribute has no meaning when a bind attribute is present. Author-optional reference to a bind element. In some cases, an XForms element may allow a Node-Set Binding, but one or more attributes in the Node-Set Binding attribute group are inappropriate for that XForms element.  In such cases, the exact attributes are listed for the XForms element, but those attributes still express a Node-Set Binding if they appear in the element.  For example, the bind element only allows the nodeset attribute.  The model and bind attributes are not allowed on a bind element, but if the nodeset attribute appears on a bind element, it does express a Node-Set Binding.  It is an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event) if the XForms Processor encounters a model  attribute  IDREF value that refers to an ID not on a model element, or a bind  attribute  IDREF value that refers to an ID not on a bind element. This collection contains one attribute for each model item property, with an attribute name exactly matching the name of the model item property, as defined in 6.1 Model Item Property Definitions. The XForms Core Module defines the major structural elements of XForms, intended for inclusion in a containing document. The elements and attributes included in this module are: Commonref (binding-expression)bind (xsd:IDREF)resource (xsd:anyURI)action (xsd:anyURI) [deprecated]mode ("asynchronous"|"synchronous")method ("post"|"get"|"put"|"delete"|"multipart-post"|"form-data-post"|"urlencoded-post"|Any other NCName|QNameButNotNCName)validate (xsd:boolean)relevant (xsd:boolean)serialization ("application/xml"|"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"|"multipart/related"|"multipart/form-data"|"none")version (xsd:NMTOKEN)indent (xsd:boolean)mediatype (xsd:string)encoding (xsd:string)omit-xml-declaration (xsd:boolean)standalone (xsd:boolean)cdata-section-elements (QNameList)replace ("all"|"instance"|"text"|"none" | QNameButNotNCName)instance (xsd:IDREF)targetref (nodeset XPath Expression)separator (';' | '&amp;')includenamespaceprefixes (xsd:NMTOKENS) Elements defined in the XForms Actions module, when that module is included, are also allowed in the content model of model and submission, as shown above. Within the containing document, these structural elements are typically not rendered. The XForms Processor must ignore any foreign-namespaced attributes that are unrecognized.  Note that the presence of foreign namespaced elements is subject to the definition of the containing or compound document profile. Common Attributes: Common Special Attributes: Author-optional space-separated list of XPath extension functions (represented by QNames) required by this XForms Model. Guidance on the use of this attribute is at 7.12 Extension Functions. Examples: Since the version attribute is not specified on the model, the XForms Processor may choose any language conformance level, which may be incompatible with the version setting of the second model.  Therefore,  the message action occurs during initialization of the second model due to its version  incompatibility with the default model. Since the version attribute is not specified on the second model, it is compatible with any choice made based on the version setting on the default model. This author-optional element contains or references initial instance data. Common Attributes: Common Special Attributes: Author-optional link to externally defined initial instance data. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-link-exception Event). Author-optional link to externally defined initial instance data. If the link is traversed and the traversal fails, it is treated as an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-link-exception Event). If the src attribute is given, then it takes precedence over inline content and the resource attribute, and the XML data for the instance is obtained from the link.  If the src attribute is omitted, then the data for the instance is obtained from inline content if it is given or the resource attribute otherwise.  If both the resource attribute and inline content are provided, the inline content takes precedence.  If the initial instance data is given by a link (from src or resource), then the instance data is formed by creating an XPath data model of the linked resource. If the link cannot be traversed, then processing halts after dispatching an xforms-link-exception with a resource-uri of the link that failed. If the initial instance data is given by inline content, then instance data is obtained by first creating a detached copy of the inline content (including namespaces inherited from the enveloping ancestors), then creating an XPath data model over the detached copy. The detached copy must consist of content that would be well-formed XML if it existed in a separate document. Note that this restricts the element content of instance to a single child element. All data relevant to the XPath data model must be preserved during processing and  as input to  submission serialization, including processing instructions, comment nodes and all whitespace. XForms authors who need additional control over the serialization of namespace nodes can use the includenamespaceprefixes attribute on the submission element. Details about the submission element and its processing are described in 11 The XForms Submission Module. Common Attributes: Common, Model Item Properties (author-optional) Special Attributes: See 6 Model Item Properties for details on model item properties. See 7.2 Evaluation Context for details on how the evaluation context is determined for each attribute of the bind element. There are many different ways a host language might include XForms. One approach uses only well-formed processing, disregarding validation. Another case uses strict validation, for example XHTML 1.0, in which only predefined elements are allowed. Another common approach is to allow unregulated content in a few select places. A host language that chooses this option can use the Extension module. Author-optional element extension is a container for application-specific extension elements from any namespace other than the XForms namespace. This specification does not define the processing of this element. Common Attributes: Common For example, RDF metadata could be attached to an individual form control as follows: This section is deleted. This chapter defines the XForms Processing Model declaratively by enumerating the various states attained by an XForms Processor and the possible state transitions that exist in each of these states. The chapter enumerates the pre-conditions and post-conditions that must be satisfied in each of these states. XForms Processors may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end results are identical to that described in this chapter. State transitions are in general initiated by sending events to parts of the XForms tree. The XForms Processing Model consists of events in the following categories: Initialization Interaction Notification Error Conditions XForms processing is defined in terms of events, event handlers, and event responses. XForms uses the events system defined in [DOM2 Events][XML Events], with an event capture phase, arrival of the event at its Target, and finally the event bubbling phase. This section defines the various stages of the initialization phase. The processor begins initialization by dispatching an event xforms-model-construct to each XForms Model in the containing document. How the XForms Processor itself is requested to initialize is implementation dependent. Dispatched to each XForms model by the XForms processor. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: All XML Schemas are loaded. If an error occurs while attempting to access or process a remote document, processing halts with an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-link-exception Event). If applicable, P3P initialization occurs. [P3P 1.0] After all XForms Models have been initialized, an xforms-model-construct-done event is dispatched to each model element. Dispatched after the completion of xforms-model-construct processing. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event happens once, no matter how many XForms Models are present in the containing document, and results in the following, for each form control: Processing can proceed in one of two different ways depending on whether an instance in a model exists when the first form control is processed. If the instance referenced on the form control existed when the first form control was processed:  The single node  binding expression is evaluated, if it exists on the form control,  to ensure that it points to a node that exists. If this is not the case then the form control should behave in the same manner as if it had bound to a model item with the relevant model item property resolved to false. Otherwise, the user interface for the form control is created and initialized. If the instance referenced on the form control did not exist when the first form control for the same instance was processed:  For the first reference to an instance a default instance is created by following the rules described below. A root instanceData element is created. An instance data element node will be created using the binding expression from the user interface control as the name. If the name is not a valid QName, processing halts with an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event).  For the second and subsequent references to an instance which was automatically created the following processing is performed: If a matching instance data node is found, the user interface control will be connected to that element. If a matching instance data node is not found, an instance data node will be created using the binding expression from the user interface control as the name. If the name is not a valid QName, processing halts with an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event).  The above steps comprise the default processing of xforms-model-construct-done. After all form controls have been initialized and all xforms-model-construct-done events have been processed, an xforms-ready event is dispatched to each model element. Dispatched as part of xforms-model-construct-done processing. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. Dispatched by the processor to advise of imminent shutdown of the XForms Processor, which can occur from user action, or from the load XForms Action, or as a result of form submission. Target: model Bubbles: No Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. Dispatched in response to: a request to rebuild the internal data structures that track computational dependencies within a particular XForms Model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: All model item properties are initialized by processing all bind elements in document order. For each bind: For each node in the selected XPath node-set, any child bind elements are recursively processed as described in the three points of this list. Dispatched in response to: a request to recalculate all calculations associated with a particular XForms Model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: C Recalculation Sequence Algorithm describes one possible method for achieving the required recalculation behavior. Dispatched in response to: a request to revalidate a particular XForms Model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None the constraint model item property is true the value is non-empty if the required model item property is true xsi:type attributes on instance data elements are processed even in the absence of external or inline schema. The applicable XML schema definitions are determined as defined in Section 3.3.1 The model Element. The default action for this event results in the following: Dispatched in response to: a request to update all form controls associated with a particular XForms Model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: All UI Expressions  are   reevaluated  (implementations may optimize this operation but must behave as if all UI Expressions are reevaluated). current values (for the appropriate form controls and related UI elements) validity the proper number of and content for repeat objects. Dispatched in response to: a user request to reset the model. Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: The instance data is reset to the tree structure and values it had immediately after having processed the xforms-ready event. Then, the events xforms-rebuild, xforms-recalculate, xforms-revalidate and xforms-refresh are dispatched to the model element in sequence. Dispatched in response to: user request to navigate to the next or previous Core Form Control. Target: Core Form Controls Bubbles: No Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for these events results in the following: Navigation according to the default navigation order. For example, on a keyboard interface, "tab" might generate an xforms-next event, while "shift+tab" might generate an xforms-previous event.  Navigation is determined on a containing document-wide basis. The host language is responsible for defining overall navigation order. The following describes a possible technique based on a navindex attribute, using individual form controls as a navigation unit: The &lt;group&gt;, &lt;repeat&gt;, and &lt;switch&gt; structures serve as container  navigation units that, instead of providing a single navigation point,  create a local navigation context for child form controls (and possibly other substructures). The navigation sequence is determined as follows: Form controls that have a navindex specified and assign a positive value to it are navigated first. Outermost form controls are navigated in increasing order of the navindex value. Values need not be sequential nor must they begin with any particular value. Form controls that have identical navindex values are to be navigated in document order. Ancestor form controls (&lt;group&gt;, &lt;repeat&gt;, and &lt;switch&gt;) establish a local navigation sequence. All form controls within a local sequence are navigated, in increasing order of the navindex value, before any outside the local sequence are navigated. Form controls that have identical navindex values are navigated in document order.  Those form controls that do not specify navindex or supply a value of "0" are navigated next. These form controls are navigated in document order. Those form controls that are disabled, hidden, or not relevant are assigned a relative order in the overall sequence but do not participate as navigable controls.  The navigation sequence past the last form control (or before the first) is undefined. XForms Processors may cycle back to the first/last control, remove focus from the form, or other possibilities. Dispatched in response to: set focus to a form control. Target: Core Form Control|group|switch|repeat Bubbles: No Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for these events results in the following: Dispatched in response to: a user request for help or hint information. Target: Core Form Control Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None The default action for these events results in the following: If the form control has help/hint elements supplied, these are used to construct a message that is displayed to the user. Otherwise, user agents may provide default help or hint messages, but are not required to. See chapter 11.2 The xforms-submit Event. See chapter 11.3 The xforms-submit-serialize Event. Dispatched in response to: Successful insertion of one or more nodes by an XForms insert action. Target: instance Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: Default Action: None; notification event only. Notification events are those with no default processing defined.  Although this event is dispatched by insert processing as a notification, repeat processing associates behavior with the capture phase of this event. Dispatched in response to: Successful deletion of one or more nodes by an XForms delete action. Target: instance Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info:  Default Action: None; notification event only. Notification events are those with no default processing defined.  Although this event is dispatched by delete processing as a notification, repeat processing associates behavior with the capture phase of this event. Dispatched in response to: a change to an instance data node bound to a core  form control. Target: Core Form Controls Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only.

Dispatched in response to: the value of an instance data node has changed such that the value can now be represented by the form control.  Target: Core Form Controls Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. This event is dispatched whenever the value of an instance data node that was not possible to represent given the constraints specified on a form control has changed such that the value can now be represented by the form control.  Dispatched in response to: the value of an instance data node has changed such that the value can not be represented by the form control.  Target: Core Form Controls Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. This event is dispatched whenever the value of an instance data node can not be represented given the constraints specified on a form control.  Dispatched in response to: a setindex action attempting to set an index outside the range of a repeat. Target: repeat Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None The default action for this event results in the following: None; notification event only. See chapter 11.4 The xforms-submit-done Event. Error indications happen as a result of unusual conditions in the XForms Processor. Some of these are "fatal" errors, which halt processing, and bear the suffix "exception". Others are simply for notification, and bear the suffix "error". For all events in this section, it is permissible for the XForms Processor to perform some kind of default handling, for example logging error messages to a file. Dispatched as an indication of: an illegal binding expression, or a model attribute that fails to point to the ID of a model element, or a bind attribute that fails to point to the ID of a bind element, or a submission attribute that fails to point to the ID of a submission element, or an instance attribute on the submission element that fails to point to an instance element in the same model element as the submission. Target: any element that can contain a binding expression Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None Default Action: Fatal error (halts processing). Dispatched as an indication of: an error occurring during XPath evaluation for a model item property (see 6 Model Item Properties). Target: model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: Default Action: Fatal error (halts processing). Dispatched as an indication of failure of the version checks defined in the description of the version attribute in Section 3.3.1 The model Element. Target: the default model Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info:  Default Action: Fatal error (halts processing). Target: model associated with the in-scope evaluation context node of the element performing the link Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info:  Default Action: Fatal error (halts processing). Dispatched by the processor immediately after the  failure of an output to render or update the rendition of content. Target: output Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: None. Default Action: None; notification event only. See chapter 11.5 The xforms-submit-error Event. When the form control is interactively changed, and has the incremental="true" setting, the event sequence described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change may be initiated at implementation dependent intervals. When the form control is interactively changed and does not have the incremental="true" setting, no events are required to be dispatched, and thus no order is defined. When the user activates the control and the value has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node, the event sequence consists of the events described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change followed by dispatching the DOMActivate event.  See 8.1.2 The input Element for an example. When focus changes from the form control and the value has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node,  the event sequence is as described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change. The implementation of an output dispatches xforms-output-error if it unable to process the output data (such as corrupt image data when the output mediatype indicates it is image data).  This event may occur each time the output is given new data (such as a change of data in the bound data node or a change of the bound data node). When a selection is interactively changed, and the select or select1 form control has the incremental="false" setting, the event sequence is described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change. When the user activates the control and the selection has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node, the event sequence consists of the events described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change followed by dispatching the DOMActivate event.  Note that this event sequence will have been preceded by the event sequence described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change at the moment the selection was changed. When focus changes from the form control and the selection has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node,   the event sequence is as described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change.  Note that this event sequence will have been preceded by the event sequence described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change at the moment the selection was changed. Activating the form control causes the event sequence defined at 4.6.8 Sequence: Activating a Trigger. Activating the form control causes the event sequence defined at 4.6.8 Sequence: Activating a Trigger, followed immediately by the event sequence defined at 4.6.9 Sequence: Submission. xforms-deselect (for each item deselected by the change, if any) xforms-select (for each item selected by the change, if any) xforms-recalculate xforms-revalidate [n] xforms-value-changed [n] xforms-valid or xforms-invalid [n] xforms-enabled or xforms-disabled [n] xforms-optional or xforms-required [n] xforms-readonly or xforms-readwrite [n] xforms-out-of-range or xforms-in-range (The order in which these events are dispatched is not defined). Perform further deferred updates as necessary DOMActivate xforms-submit xforms-submit-serialize xforms-submit-done or xforms-submit-error  For each model element, the XForms Processor maintains the state in an internal structure called instance data that conforms to the XPath Data Model [XPath 1.0]. XForms Processors that implement DOM must provide DOM access to this instance data via the interface defined below.  Instance data always has a single root element, and thus corresponds to a DOM Document.  The IDL for this interface follows: If the instance-id parameter is the empty string, then the document element of the default instance is returned.  Otherwise,  this method returns a DOM Document that corresponds to the instance data associated with the instance element containing an ID matching the instance-id parameter. If there is no matching instance data, a DOMException is thrown.  This method signals the XForms Processor to rebuild any internal data structures used to track computational dependencies within this XForms Model. This method takes no parameters and raises no exceptions.  This method signals the XForms Processor to perform a full recalculation of this XForms Model. This method takes no parameters and raises no exceptions.  This method signals the XForms Processor to perform a full revalidation of this XForms Model. This method takes no parameters and raises no exceptions.  This method signals the XForms Processor to perform a full refresh of form controls bound to instance nodes within this XForms Model. This method takes no parameters and raises no exceptions.  For this version of the XForms specification, the feature string for the [DOM2 Core] DOMImplementation interface hasFeature method call is "org.w3c.xforms.dom" and the version string is "1.0".  This chapter defines the datatypes used in defining an XForms Model. XForms supports all XML Schema  1.0  datatypes except for xsd:duration, xsd:ENTITY, xsd:ENTITIES, and xsd:NOTATION. Concepts value space, lexical space and constraining facets are as specified in [XML Schema part 2].  XForms Processors must treat these datatypes  as in-scope without requiring the inclusion of an XML Schema. The built-in datatype xsd:duration is not supported, except as an abstract datatype. Instead, either xforms:dayTimeDuration or xforms:yearMonthDuration should be used. XForms defines the following types in the XForms namespace. These datatypes can be used in the type model item property without a namespace prefix when the default namespace is the XForms namespace. All of these datatypes allow empty content. XForms Processors must treat these datatypes as in-scope without requiring the inclusion of an XML Schema.  Many default XML schema types report empty content as invalid, which conflicts with the use of the required model item property.  The following XForms datatypes are defined as having a lexical space consisting of either the empty string or the lexical space of  the corresponding XML schema datatype. Although some XML schema datatypes do allow empty string content,   they have also  been added to the available XForms datatypes for form authoring consistency.  Built-in primitive types (in the XForms namespace): dateTimetimedategYearMonthgYeargMonthDaygDaygMonthstringbooleanbase64BinaryhexBinaryfloatdecimaldoubleanyURIQName Built-in derived types (in the XForms namespace): normalizedStringtokenlanguageNameNCNameIDIDREFIDREFSNMTOKENNMTOKENSintegernonPositiveIntegernegativeIntegerlongintshortbytenonNegativeIntegerunsignedLongunsignedIntunsignedShortunsignedBytepositiveInteger This datatype serves as a base for the listItems datatype. The lexical space for listItem permits one or more characters valid for xsd:string, except white space characters.  In most cases, it is better to use markup to distinguish items in a list. See 9.3.6 The itemset Element. The dayTimeDuration datatype is made available by the XForms processor based on the following lexical space definition: The yearMonthDuration datatype is made available by the XForms processor based on the following lexical space definition: Examples of valid xforms:email addresses editors@example.com~my_mail+{nospam}$?@sub-domain.example.info Examples of invalid xforms:email addresses editors@(this is a comment)example.infoeditors{at}example{dot}infomailto:editors@example.com It is outside the scope of XForms to determine whether a given email address actually corresponds to an active mailbox. The email datatype is made available by the XForms processor based on the following lexical space definition: The display representation of this datatype by form controls is not required to match the lexical space of the bound instance data. User agents should apply appropriate conventions to the display and input of values, including separator characters. The standard defines the structure of the number as well as how to apply the Luhn formula to ensure a correct check digit. This type only specifies the format of the number.  The complementary XPath function is-card-number() should be used to validate that the ID number conforms to the specification. This chapter defines infoset contributions that can be bound to instance data nodes with element bind (see 3.3.4 The bind Element). The combination of these contributions to an instance data node is called a model item. Taken together, these contributions are called model item properties, and are defined in the following section. In contrast, the term Schema constraint refers only to XML Schema constraints from the facets of a given datatype. Model item properties can be distinguished along various axes. Computed expressions vs. fixed properties: Fixed properties are static values that the XForms Processor evaluates only once. Such properties consist of literals, and are not subject to XPath evaluation. Computed expressions are XPath expressions that provide a value to the XForms Processor. Such values are recalculated at certain times as specified by the XForms Processing Model (see 4 Processing Model). These expressions encode dynamic properties, often constraints, such as the dependency among various data items. Computed expressions are not restricted to examining the value of the instance data node to which they apply. XPath expressions provide the means to traverse the instance data; more complex computations may be encoded as call-outs to external scripts. Inheritance rules: Some model item properties define inheritance rules, in which case the XForms Processor needs to keep track of two separate values: 1) the local value, which is applied from an attribute of element bind, and 2) the inherited value, which is determined by combining the evaluated local value with the evaluated values from ancestor nodes in the instance data. The sample recalculation algorithm defined in C Recalculation Sequence Algorithm is defined to operate only on the local values of a model item property. It assumes that an implementation propagates the combined values to a node's descendants. Assigning local values: Local values are assigned by processing all bind elements in an XForms Model in document order. It is an error to attempt to set a model item property twice on the same node (see 4.3.1 The xforms-rebuild Event for details)..  The following sections list the model item properties available as part of all model items. For each, the following information is provided: DescriptionComputed Expression (yes or no)Legal ValuesDefault ValueInheritance Rules Computed Expression: No. Default Value: xsd:string. Inheritance Rules: does not inherit. This model item property contributes to the overall validity assessment of a node; the effect of validity state on bound form controls is described in Section 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls. The first bind expresses the default datatype of xsd:string. Description: describes whether the node content is restricted from changing.  Computed Expression: Yes.  Legal Values: Any expression that is convertible to XPath boolean with boolean().  Default Value: false(), unless a calculate  is specified for the value property, then true().  Inheritance Rules: If any ancestor node evaluates to true, this value is treated as true. Otherwise, the local value is used. This is the equivalent of taking the logical OR of the evaluated readonly property on the local and every ancestor node. When  true, this model item property indicates that the XForms Processor  must not allow any direct changes to the content of the  bound instance data node  from constructs other than the model item property system (i.e. other than a calculate). Instance mutations performed by submission, form controls, DOM interface access, and XForms actions must not insert or copy a new node into a parent node that is readonly, delete or replace a node whose parent is readonly, nor change the value or content of a readonly node.  A node that is readonly but whose parent is not readonly can be entirely deleted or replaced by a submission even though doing so indirectly results in deletion or replacement of readonly descendant nodes. In addition to restricting value changes, the readonly model item property provides information to the XForms user interface  about how bound form controls should be rendered. Form controls bound to instance data with the readonly model item property  that evaluates to true  should indicate that entering or changing the value is not allowed. This specification does not define any effect of the readonly model item property  on visibility, focus, or navigation order.  Here, we have associated a readonly property with an element. The following example illustrates the ability to override the default readonly setting on calculated nodes. The calculate on my:data is executed on any recalculate that follows a rebuild, including the form initialization, so the user initially sees the word 'default'. The user may make any change to my:data with the input, and the calculation will be executed again as a result.  Therefore, if the user enters an empty value, then the calculate will change my:data back to 'default'. Description: describes whether a value is required before the instance data is submitted. Computed Expression: Yes. Legal Values: Any expression that is convertible to XPath boolean with boolean().  Default Value: false().  Inheritance Rules: does not inherit. A form may require certain values, and this requirement may be dynamic. When evaluating to true, this model item property indicates that a non-empty instance data node is required before a submission of instance data can occur. Non-empty is defined as: The value of the bound instance data node must be convertible to an XPath string with a length greater than zero.  The XML Schema feature represented by nillable and xsi:nil is unrelated to the XForms required model item property.  An element may have the xsi:nil attribute set to true to indicate that its empty content is schema valid, but if the required model item property for that element node is true, then the element violates the required constraint because a required node must be non-empty as defined above. Here, we have associated a required property with element my:last-name to indicate that a value must be supplied. XML Schema has a similarly named concept with use="required|optional|prohibited". This is different than the XForms Model item property, in two ways: 1) use applies only to attributes, while XForms required applies to any node. 2) use is concerned with whether the entire attribute must be specified (without regard to value), while required determines whether a value is required of the node before submission.  Description: indicates whether the model item is currently relevant. Instance data nodes with this property evaluating to false are unavailable in the user interface and can be removed from submission serialization. Computed Expression: Yes. Legal Values: Any expression that is convertible to XPath boolean with boolean(). Default Value: true(). Inheritance Rules: If any ancestor node evaluates to XPath false, this value is treated as false. Otherwise, the local value is used. This is the equivalent of taking the logical AND of the evaluated relevant property on the local and every ancestor node. Many forms have data entry sections that depend on other conditions. For example, a form might ask whether the respondent owns a car. It is only appropriate to ask for further information about their car if they have indicated that they own one. Through single node UI bindings,  the relevant model item property provides information to the XForms user interface regarding visibility, focus, and navigation order. In general, when true, associated form controls should be made available for user interaction. When false, associated form controls (and any children) and group and switch elements (including content) must be made unavailable, removed from the navigation order, and not allowed focus. Typically, non-relevant user interface  content is not presented, or it may be styled as disabled. Elements other than form controls may also use a single node binding that selects a non-relevant node, but such elements are not made unavailable or non-operable due to the single node binding because it is not a UI binding expression.  For example, actions such as 10.2 The setvalue Element and 10.16 The message Element or the 11.1 The submission Element remain operable if their single node bindings select a non-relevant node.  However, some such elements may indirectly be affected by the relevant model item property.  For example, it is possible for non-relevant nodes to be excluded from the data of a submission.  Similarly, non-relevance indirectly affects the running of actions because a non-relevant form control disables event handlers that listen for events targeted at the form control element.  A core  form control, group or switch must express a single node binding in order to be associated with an instance node. Due to the definition of repeat object, the relevant model item property of the node in the associated repeat item affects the availability of the repeat object. Here, we have associated a relevant property with element my:discount to indicate a discount is relevant when the order amount is greater than 1000. Description: supplies an expression used to calculate  a string value for  the associated instance data node. Computed Expression: Yes. Legal Values: Any XPath expression. Default Value: none. Inheritance Rules: does not inherit. An XForms Model may include model items whose string values are computed from other values. For example, the sum over line items for quantity times unit price, or the amount of tax to be paid on an order.  The formula for  such a computed value can be expressed with a calculate property, whose XPath expression is evaluated, converted to a string with the XPath string() function, and stored as the value content of the calculated data node. Chapter 4 Processing Model contains details of when and how the calculation is performed. Here, we have associated a relevant property with element my:discount to indicate a discount of 10% is relevant when the order amount is greater than 1000. Description: specifies a predicate that needs to be satisfied for the associated instance data node to be considered valid. Computed Expression: Yes. Legal Values: Any expression that is convertible to XPath boolean with boolean(). Default Value: true(). Inheritance Rules: does not inherit.  When evaluating to XPath false, the associated model item is not valid; the converse is not necessarily true. This model item property does not prevent form controls and XForms actions from setting invalid values into data nodes. Chapter 4 Processing Model contains details of when and how the constraint is calculated as well as when validation is performed. This model item property contributes to the overall validity assessment of a node; the effect of validity state on bound form controls is described in Section 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls. Here, a constraint property associated with element my:to indicates that its value must be greater than that of element my:from. Specifying minimum and maximum occurrences for nodes in the instance data can be achieved by using the count() function within a constraint property. Description: Attaches a P3P data element to an instance data node, indicating the specific kind of data collected there. Computed Expression: No. Legal Values: xsd:string. Default Value: none Inheritance Rules: does not inherit. This model item property holds a description of the kind of data collected by the associated instance data node, based on the P3P datatype system [P3P 1.0]. This information may be used to enhance the form-fill experience, for example by supplying previously-known data.  Here, we have attached both XML Schema and P3P type information to element first-name via element bind. Chapter 5 Datatypes described how XForms uses the XML Schema datatype system to constrain the value space of data values collected by an XForms Model. Such datatype constraints can be provided via an XML Schema. Alternatively, this section lists various mechanisms for attaching type constraints to instance data. Attributes xsi:schemaLocation and xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation are ignored for purposes for locating a Schema. The XForms Processing Model applies XML Schema facets as part of the validation process. At the simplest level, it is necessary to associate a set of facets (through an XML Schema datatype) with a model item. This has the effect of restricting the allowable values of the associated instance data node to valid representations of the lexical space of the datatype.  The set of facets associated with a model item must be determined by the following list, as if it were processed in the given order. When multiple datatype restrictions apply to the same model item, the combination of all given restrictions must apply. Note that it is possible to produce a combination of restrictions that is impossible to satisfy; authors are encouraged to avoid this practice. Applicable XML schema definitions (including those associated an external or an inline schema, or by xsi:type) An XForms type constraint associated with the instance data node using XForms binding. If no type constraint is provided, the instance data node defaults to type="xsd:string" (default to string rule). The following declares a datatype based on xsd:string with an additional constraining facet. This new datatype would then be associated with one or more model items through one of the methods outlined here. This defines element first-name to be of type my:nonEmptyString.   Here, we have attached type information to element first-name via element bind. Thus the XForms author can extend external schemas without having the ability to change them.  XForms uses XPath to address instance data nodes in binding expressions, to express constraints, and to specify calculations. XPath expressions in XForms are based on [XPath 1.0]. A future version of XForms is expected to enable use of  [XPath 2.0].  At the time of evaluation, an XPath expression must be syntactically correct. In addition, the namespaces the expression references must be in scope and the functions and variables it references must be defined. If any of these conditions is not satisfied, an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event) is raised, except for binding expressions, which produce a different exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). XPath datatypes are used only in binding expressions and computed expressions. XForms uses XPath datatypes boolean, string, number, and node-set. Additionally, the type object is used to denote a parameter or return value that can be any one of the four XPath datatypes.  A future version of XForms is expected to use XPath 2.0, which includes support for XML Schema datatypes.  Within XForms, the default model is the first model in document order.  The default instance of any model is the first child instance in document order within that model.  XPath expressions appearing in various XForms attributes are used to reference  instance data.  Every XPath expression requires an evaluation context consisting of a node, position, size, variable bindings, function set, and namespace context.  For all evaluation contexts in XForms, No variable bindings are in place.   The available function library is defined below in 7.5 The XForms Function Library.   Any namespace declarations in scope for the attribute that defines the expression are applied to the expression.  The context node, position and size are determined according to rules described below. A binding element is any element that is explicitly allowed to have a binding expression attribute, and a bound element is any element that explicitly declares a binding expression attribute. A binding expression attribute contains an XPath expression that references zero or more nodes of instance data.  Every XPath expression requires an evaluation context. The in-scope evaluation context of a binding element provides an evaluation context for the binding expression attribute.  The following rules are used in determining the node, position and size of the in-scope evaluation context:  A binding element is "outermost" if the element has no ancestor binding elements. If an outermost binding element is contained by a model, then the context node for the outermost binding element is the top-level document element node of the default instance of the containing model element. Otherwise, the context node for outermost binding elements is the top-level document element node of the default instance in the default model.  For outermost binding elements, the context size and position are 1.  The context node, position and size for non-outermost binding elements is determined using  the binding expression attribute or in-scope evaluation context  of the  nearest ancestor binding element.  This is also referred to as "scoped resolution". For a non-outermost binding element: If the nearest ancestor binding element is not a bound element, then the in-scope evaluation context of the non-outermost binding element is equivalent to the in-scope evaluation context of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Single-Node binding, then the in-scope evaluation context of the non-outermost binding element has a context size and position of 1 and the context node is the one resulting from the Single-Node binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Node Set binding, then the XForms processor dynamically generates an occurrence of the non-outermost binding element for each of the nodes in the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element.  The dynamic in-scope evaluation context for each generated occurrence of the non-outermost binding element has a context size equal to the size of the nodeset identified by the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element, the context node is the node for which the occurrence of the non-outermost binding element was generated, and the position is equal to the position of the generator node in the nodeset identified by the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Node Set binding, then the non-outermost binding element has its own in-scope evaluation context separately from those of its dynamically generated occurences described above.  The in-scope evaluation context has a context position of 1, and the context node and size are set by the first node and the size of the nodeset identified by the Node Set binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. Once the context node of the in-scope evaluation context has been determined according to the rules above, if the binding element expresses a model attribute that refers to a model other than the one containing the context node, then the context node of the in-scope evaluation context is changed to be the top-level document element node of the default instance of the referenced model, and the context position and size are changed to 1. The in-scope evaluation context of an element that is not a binding element is the same as if the element were a binding element. For example, the in-scope evaluation context for the setindex action element is required to provide the context for evaluating the index attribute, so it is determined as if the element could contain a binding expression attribute. XPath expressions also appear in model item property attributes of the bind element to define computed expressions.  If the bind element does not express a Node Set binding, then the in-scope evaluation context for model item property attributes of the bind is equal to the in-scope evaluation context for the bind.  Otherwise, the bind has a Node Set binding, and computed expressions for each model item property attribute are generated for each node.  For each computed expression generated, the evaluation context node, position and size are determined by the same method as dynamic in-scope evaluation context rule above, except the computed expression is used in lieu of a binding expression attribute such that the bind element is the nearest ancestor binding element. XPath expressions also appear in the special attributes of several other XForms elements, such as the value attribute on setvalue and output, the at attribute of insert and delete, or the index attribute of setindex.  Generally, if the containing element does not express a Single Node Binding or Node Set Binding, then the special attribute is evaluated using the in-scope evaluation context.  Special attributes may be evaluated using the in-scope evaluation context even if the containing element expresses a Single Node Binding or Node Set Binding.  However, for some special attributes, the evaluation context node, position and size are based on the result of the Single Node Binding or Node set Binding.  Each special attribute that contains an XPath expression describes how its evaluation context node, position and size are determined.  In the following example, the group has a binding expression of level2/level3. According to the rules above, this outermost element node would have a context node of /level1, which is the  document element node of the instance data. The select1 form control then inherits a context node from the parent group.  This section describes how the in-scope evaluation context of an element is determined, not whether the in-scope evaluation will be used.  The Single-Node Binding or Node Set Binding of a non-outermost binding element is not evaluated if the in-scope evaluation context does not contain a context node.  This can occur if the Single-Node Binding or Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor bound element produces an empty nodeset.  Also, if the Single-Node Binding or Node Set Binding of an element is expressed with the bind attribute, then the resulting node or nodeset is obtained from the referenced bind element.  The nodeset attribute of a bind element is evaluated using the in-scope evaluation of the bind element, not the in-scope evaluation context of an element that references it with a bind attribute. Given the following default instance: and the following XPath expression: Finally, note that an XPath expression can reference many nodes even if its final result is an empty nodeset. Defining a reference in terms of matching a NodeTest was a deliberate design decision that creates more references than necessary in order to make the computation system more responsive to certain types of changes without needing a rebuild operation. When a leaf node is filtered from an expression by a predicate, the leaf node is still considered to be referenced so that if the condition changes such that the leaf node would be included in the result value of the expression, then the expression will be recalculated without needing a rebuild.  However, once a node is rejected from an expression, further location steps are not evaluated relative to the rejected node, so references for that location step are only created based on its execution relative to accepted nodes.  For example, if the above expression were in a calculate, and if the attribute of either b element changes to the value X, the expression would be recalculated but it still does not record a reference to any c elements until the references are obtained in the next rebuild operation. Moreover, the excess references created by the definition may cause some recalculation constructs to cease operation due to circular references that would not be created with a stricter definition of a reference. A future version of XForms may use a stricter version of referencing for recalculation and a less strict definition of referencing for the purpose of detecting and performing automatic rebuild operations. The referencing of a repeat index by the index() function is handled as a special case.  Implementations must behave as if each occurrence of a repeat is associated with an implicitly managed instance data node containing the repeat index.  If a repeat identified as R1 contains a repeat identified as R2, then a repeat index instance node is managed for each occurrence of R2 that is generated by R1.  An invocation of the function index() in an XPath expression is considered to reference the repeat index instance node corresponding to the repeat index value that it returns. The computational dependency data structure described in Section 4.3.2 The xforms-recalculate Event essentially stores the dependency lists of instance nodes corresponding to all the references made by computed expressions (see Appendix C Recalculation Sequence Algorithm for details).  The computational dependency data structure is not reconstructed in response to a dynamic dependency change.  Instead, the form author may request a rebuild of the computational dependency data structures using the rebuild action.  Additionally, the insert and delete actions set a rebuild flag so that computational dependency data structures will be rebuild at the end of an action sequence. Due to the rebuild flag setting on insert and delete, a form author can use many kinds of dynamic dependencies in model binding expressions and computed expressions without ever explicitly invoking the rebuild action.  This includes the use of functions such as position(), last(), and count() on element and attribute nodes because the return values of the functions in these cases is fixed except when an insert or delete occurs.  By comparison, functions such as id(), instance(), and index() can establish dynamic dependencies that can necessitate invoking a rebuild if they are used in model binding expressions or computed expressions because the results of the functions are affected by changing the values of instance nodes, not by inserting or deleting nodes.  There are several different categories of XPath expressions used in XForms, and they are processed at different times depending on the category.   A binding expression is an XPath  expression used to bind a model item property to one or more instance nodes, or to bind a form control to instance data, or to specify the node or node set for operation by an action.  The evaluation schedule for binding expressions differs based on whether the binding expression is a model binding expression, UI binding expression, or a binding expression for an XForms action.  XPath expressions are also used in various other attributes of XForms binds, actions, form controls, and submissions, and their descendant elements.  These expressions follow one of the three schedules associated with binding expressions as described below.  A model binding expression is a kind of binding expression that can be used to declare model item properties, and is used in the Node-Set binding of the bind element. A computed expression is an XPath expression used to determine the value of a model item property based on instance data.  Several of the attributes of bind are computed expressions, including calculate, readonly, relevant, and required. Dynamic dependencies in model binding expressions and computed expressions will  require manual rebuilding of dependencies. If the index() function is being invoked from a model binding expression or computed expression, it will be necessary to invoke rebuild manually.  If the repeat index change occurs due to an implicit behavior such as a change to the focused form control, then the rebuild (along with recalculate, revalidate and refresh) can be invoked from a handler for DOMFocusIn attached to the repeat or each repeat object. Binding expressions on XForms actions and XPath expressions appearing in other attributes of XForms actions are evaluated at the time the XForms action is performed. In some cases, XForms actions have child elements that allow the values of some of their attributes to be determined based on instance data.  In these cases, the value attribute of the child element is evaluated at the time the corresponding attribute is needed in the processing model of the containing XForms action. Similarly, XPath expressions used in the attributes of submission and its child elements (other than XForms actions) are evaluated as needed within the submission processing model. Form authors can use dynamic dependencies in the XPath expressions of XForms Actions and Submissions without invoking any special data structure reconstruction actions because implementations must behave as if these expressions are evaluated as needed. Form authors can use dynamic dependencies in UI Expressions without invoking any special data structure reconstruction actions because the state of the user interface at the end of processing xforms-refresh is required to reflect the instance data as if all UI Expressions had been re-evaluated. Implementations may record UI Expression dependency lists on instance nodes to help streamline detection of the need to re-evaluate a UI Expression at the beginning of processing for xforms-refresh.  Such implementations may determine that a UI Expression is stale (needs re-evaluation) when a node on which it depends has been changed.  An implementation may also indicate that all UI Expressions are stale if a node of instance data is inserted, deleted or replaced, or the implementation may streamline detection of which UI Expressions may be affected by the insertion, deletion or replacement of an instance data node.  The XForms binding mechanism allows other XML vocabularies to make single node bindings between custom user interface controls and XForms instance data. As an example, XForms binding attribute bind might be used within XHTML 1.x user interface controls as shown below. See 3.2.3 Single-Node Binding Attributes.  Consider the following document with the one-and-only XForms model:  The following examples show three ways of binding user interface control xforms:input to instance element firstName declared in the model shown above.   The XForms Function Library includes the entire [XPath 1.0] Core Function Library, including operations on node-sets, strings, numbers, and booleans.  The function library provided by an XForms processor may also contain other extension functions as described in 7.12 Extension Functions. If an error occurs in an XPath function, then an  4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event or 4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event occurs..  boolean boolean-from-string(string) boolean is-card-number(string?) If the string parameter conforms to the pattern restriction of the card-number datatype, then this function applies the Luhn  algorithm described in [Luhn Patent] and returns true if the number satisfies the formula.  Otherwise, false is returned. If the parameter is omitted, it defaults to the string-value of the current context node. Examples (see also 5.2.7 xforms:card-number): returns true if and only if the context node contains a string that contains of zero or more digits and satisfies the formula. returns true. Other examples of string constants that will return true are : 5431111111111111, 341111111111111 and 6011601160116611. returns false. number avg(node-set) number min(node-set)  Function min returns the minimum value of the result of converting the string-values of each node in argument node-set to a number. "Minimum" is determined with the &lt; operator. If the parameter is an empty node-set, or if any of the nodes evaluate to NaN, the return value is NaN.  number max(node-set)  Function max returns the maximum value of the result of converting the string-values of each node in argument node-set to a number. "Maximum" is determined with the &lt; operator. If the parameter is an empty node-set, or if any of the nodes evaluate to NaN, the return value is NaN.  number count-non-empty(node-set)  Function count-non-empty returns the number of non-empty nodes in argument node-set. A node is considered non-empty if it is convertible into a string with a greater-than zero length.  number index(string) number power(number, number) Examples: returns 8 returns NaN. number random(boolean?) Example: could return 0.14159265358979 number compare(string, string) This function returns -1, 0, or 1, depending on whether the value of the first argument is respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the value of second argument based on lexicographic comparison using Unicode code point values [Unicode Collation Algorithm].  Example: returns -1 string if(boolean, string, string) Function if evaluates the first parameter as boolean, returning the second parameter when true, otherwise the third parameter.  This function is deprecated because a future version of XForms is expected to be based on [XPath 2.0], which contains an if construct that is incompatible with this function.Form authors and design tools are encouraged to use the function choose() from Section 7.11.1 The choose() Function instead of this function.  string property(string) This function accepts a string identifying a property name.  If the property name is not recognized, empty string is returned.  The property definitions for this function are as follows:  Examples: returns 1.1 may return full string digest(string, string, string?) returns a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d. returns 900150983cd24fb0d6963f7d28e17f72. returns ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad string hmac(string, string, string, string?) The following table presents the keywords for the third string parameter and the corresponding hash algorithms: returns effcdf6ae5eb2fa2d27416d5f184df9c259a7c79 returns 750c783e6ab0b503eaa86e310a5db738 returns 5bdcc146bf60754e6a042426089575c75a003f089d2739839dec58b964ec3843 string local-date() Example: could return 2006-10-13-07:00 could return 2006-10-13 returns a date that is 31 days from today. For example, if local-date() returns 2006-10-13-07:00, then the result is 2006-11-13. string local-dateTime() Example: could return 2006-10-13T16:04:17-07:00 string now()  returns 2006-10-14T01:04:17Z if local-dateTime() returns 2006-10-13T18:04:17-07:00 number days-from-date(string) This function returns a whole number of days, according to the following rules:  Examples: returns 11688 returns 11688 returns -1 string days-to-date(number) This function returns a string containing a lexical xsd:date that corresponds to the number of days passed as the parameter according to the following rules:  Examples: returns 2002-01-01 returns 1969-12-31 number seconds-from-dateTime(string) This function returns a possibly fractional number of seconds, according to the following rules:  Example: returns 0 returns 28800 string seconds-to-dateTime(number) Examples: returns 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z returns 1970-01-01T08:00:00Z string adjust-dateTime-to-timezone(string) Examples: returns 2007-10-07T02:22:00-07:00 in the Pacific time zone since daylight savings time applies. returns 2007-10-02T14:26:43-07:00 in the Pacific time zone since daylight savings time applies. number seconds(string) This function returns a possibly fractional number of seconds, according to the following rules:  Examples:  returns 297001.5  (3 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes, and 1.5 seconds) returns 0  because the year and month parts of the duration are ignored and the remaining portions are unspecified and default to 0 returns NaN  because the parameter is not a lexically valid duration number months(string) This function returns a whole number of months, according to the following rules:  Examples:  Examples:  returns 14  (1 year and 2 months)  returns -19  because the duration is negative and expresses 0 years and 19 months  node-set instance(string?) Example: For instance data corresponding to this XML:  The following expression selects the firstName node. Note that the instance function returns an element node, effectively replacing the leftmost location step from the path:  node-set current() Returns the context node used to initialize the evaluation of the containing XPath expression. Examples: For the following instance data: and the following value calculation bind: For the following instance data: and the following repeat structure: the output should contain Jan Feb Mar. node-set id(object, node-set?) Example: Returns nodes identified by X or Y from the instance data document associated with the root element of  the instance identified by Z. node-set context() This function returns the in-scope evaluation context node of the nearest ancestor element of the node containing the XPath expression that invokes this function.  The nearest ancestor element may have been created dynamically as part of the run-time expansion of repeated content as described in Section 4.7 Resolving ID References in XForms. Example: This action sets node x to the value of node y, where both nodes are children of the in-scope evaluation context node for the setvalue element. An intended use of this function is in conjunction with the repeat element (Section 9.3.1 The repeat Element and the setvalue action element (Section 10.2 The setvalue Element).  The intent is to provide form authors with a means of expressing a value attribute that is relative to the repeat context node when the Single Node Binding result is not. object choose(boolean, object, object) All parameters of an XPath function are evaluated, so the parameter that is not returned by this function is still evaluated, and its result is discarded by this function. Form authors and design tools are encouraged to use this function instead of the function if() described in Section 7.8.1 The if() Function, which has been deprecated.  Because this function returns an object instead of a string, migrating from if() to choose() may occasionally require conversion of the return result using the string() function. Example: Returns the node-set of matching x if it is non-empty and the node-set matching y otherwise. If the context node of the function contains attribute x, then the nodeset containing that attribute is returned.  Otherwise, the number 0 is returned. object event(string) The event context properties available for each event are provided in the sections that describe the events. Examples: If called from an xforms-insert event handler, a nodeset is returned containing the instance data node or nodes inserted. XForms documents may use additional XPath extension functions beyond those described here. A number of useful community extensions are defined at [EXSLT]. The names of any such extension functions must be declared in attribute functions on element model. Such declarations are used by the XForms Processor to check against available extension functions. XForms Processors perform this check at the time the document is loaded, and halt processing by signaling an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event) if the XForms document declares an extension function for which the processor does not have an implementation.   Explicitly declaring extension functions enables XForms Processors to detect the use of unimplemented extension functions at document load-time, rather than throwing a fatal exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event or 4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event) during user interaction. Failure by authors to declare extension functions will result in an XForms Processor potentially halting processing during user interaction with a fatal error.  Unless bound to form controls, instance data nodes are not presented to the user; consequently, there is no need for a form control corresponding to HTML input type="hidden".  The following table summarizes additional support elements for form controls. See also: 9.3.6 The itemset Element  (for selection controls) and 9.3.7 The copy Element (for selection controls). The following attributes are common to many user-interface related XForms elements, here called the UI Common attribute group. Author-optional attribute to define an appearance hint. If absent, the user agent may freely choose any suitable rendering. A host language is expected to add attributes such as xml:lang as well as an attribute, named class, that holds a list of strings that can be matched by CSS class selectors. Further, a host language must provide a way to indicate overall navigation order among form controls and other elements included in the host language, as well as keyboard or direct access navigation to specific elements. One such proposal is to uses a pair of attributes named navindex and accesskey, defined as follows: This author-optional attribute is a non-negative integer in the range of 0-32767 used to define the navigation sequence. This gives the author control over the sequence in which form controls are traversed. The default navigation order is specified in the chapter 4 Processing Model. This author-optional attribute defines a shortcut for moving the input focus directly to a particular form control. The value of this is a single character which when pressed together with a platform specific modifier key (e.g., the alt key) results in the focus being set to this form control. The user agent must provide a means of identifying the accesskeys that can be used in a presentation. This may be accomplished in different ways by different implementations, for example through direct interaction with the application or via the user's guide. The accesskey requested by the author might not be made available by the player (for example it may not exist on the device used, or it may be used by the player itself). Therefore the user agent should make the specified key available, but may map the accesskey to a different interaction behavior. Additionally, this module defines the following content sets: As shown above, the XML Events module adds the Actions content set into the UI Common content set. A host language may add markup to the UI Content set. When the XForms Extension module is present, it too should be included in the UI Common content set. XForms user interface controls are bound to the underlying instance data using binding attributes as defined in the chapter 6 Model Item Properties. Form controls enable accessibility by taking a uniform approach to such features as labels, help text, navigation, and keyboard shortcuts. Internationalization issues are addressed by following the same design principles as in XHTML. All form controls are suitable for styling as aural or visual media. Form controls encapsulate high-level semantics without sacrificing the ability to deliver real implementations. For instance, the form control select enables the user to select items from a set. These form controls distinguish the functional aspects of the underlying control from the presentational and behavioral aspects. This separation enables the expression of the intent underlying a particular form control&mdash;see [AUI97] for a definition of such high-level user interaction primitives.  Form controls when rendered display the underlying data values to which they are bound. While the data presented to the user through a form control must directly correspond to the bound instance data, the display representation is not required to match the lexical  space  value  of the bound instance data. For example, user agents should apply appropriate conventions to the display of dates, times, durations and numeric values including separator characters. All form controls must meet the following implementation requirements: All form controls, including container form controls, should have an inline layout by default (e.g. for a host language that supports CSS, the default styling should be display:inline).  By default, repeat items should have a block layout (e.g. a default styling of display:block for host languages that support CSS). If a form control violates its data binding restriction, an xforms-binding-exception must occur. Form controls that read or write simpleContent produce this exception whenever and as soon as they are bound to an element node that has an element child node. Form controls that write simpleContent to instance data must do so exactly as defined by the XForms Action setvalue (10.2 The setvalue Element). If a form control binds to an element node, then regardless of how many child nodes the element has, the result of the form control writing to the bound element node is that it has either a single non-empty text node child, or no children if the simpleContent written is the empty string (which is in accord with the data model of [XPath 1.0]). All form controls that read simpleContent instance data must do so as follows: Attribute nodes: returns the string-value of the node. Text nodes: returns the string-value of the node. Namespace, processing instruction, and comment nodes: behavior is undefined (implementation-dependent). the XPath root node: an xforms-binding-exception occurs. the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to empty nodeset, the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to a non-relevant instance node, the form control is contained by a non-relevant switch or group (which includes a non-relevant repeat item), or the form control is contained by a non-selected case element of a switch. Except as noted, relevant form controls must distinguish rendering between being bound to a required node versus a non-required node. Exceptions are form controls that do not directly render the string value of the bound node (including trigger and the container form controls).  Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. Relevant  form controls must distinguish rendering between valid and invalid states. Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. Relevant  form controls must indicate when the bound instance data contains a value or content that  the form control is not capable of rendering. Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. If a form control binds to a readonly node, then the form control must not allow the user to modify the node value.  The relevant form control that is bound to a readonly node  should render in a way which indicates that entering or changing the value is not allowed. Control of the render behavior should be made available to stylesheets.  Sections in this chapter define the various form controls by specifying the following: DescriptionCommon AttributesSpecial AttributesExamplesData Binding RestrictionsImplementation Requirements Description: This form control enables free-form data entry  or a user interface component appropriate to the datatype of the bound node.. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent (except xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary or any datatype derived from these). This control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Implementation Requirements: Must allow entry of a lexical value for the bound datatype. Implementations should provide a convenient means for entry of datatypes and take into account localization and internationalization issues such as representation of numbers. For example, an input bound to an instance data node of type xsd:date might provide a calendar control to enter dates; similarly, an input control bound to of type boolean might be rendered as a checkbox. Examples:  In the above, the class attribute can be used by a style sheet to specify the display size of the form control. Note that the constraints on how much text can be input are obtained from the underlying XForms Model definition and not from these display properties. A graphical browser might render the above example as follows:    A graphical browser might render the above example as follows:    The user can type a date into the text edit box, or press the button to open a calendar:    A graphical browser on a desktop device might activate form controls such as input in response to a special user action such as pressing the Enter key or either clicking or double-clicking with the mouse (depending on the type of form control). Description: This form control is used to provide the user with the ability to supply information to the system in a manner that makes it difficult for someone, other than the user, who may be observing the process to discern the value that is being supplied. A common use is for password entry. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent (except xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary or any datatype derived from these). This control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Implementation Requirements: Implementations, including accessibility aids, must obscure the value being entered into this form control. One possible approach would be to render a "*" or similar character instead of the actual characters entered. Note that this provides only a casual level of security; truly sensitive information will require additional security measures outside the scope of XForms. Example: A graphical browser might render this form control as follows:   Description: This form control enables free-form data entry and is intended for use in entering multiline content, e.g., the body of an email message. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent (except xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary or any datatype derived from these). This control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Implementation Requirements: Must allow entry of a lexical value for the bound datatype, including multiple lines of text.  Example:  In the above, the class attribute can be used by a style sheet to specify the display size of the form control. Note that the constraints on how much text can be input are obtained from the underlying XForms Model definition and not from these display properties. A graphical browser might render the above example as follows:    Description: This form control renders content based in part on instance data, but it provides no means for entering or changing data.   Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: This form control does not use the UI Common attribute group, but nevertheless still contains an author-optional appearance attribute, as defined above. Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent. This control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Element output can be used to display the value  of a particular instance node  by using a Single-Node Binding; it can also be used to display the result of evaluating an XPath expression by specifying the XPath expression to be evaluated via attribute value. Note that the Single-Node Binding attributes  and value on element output are mutually exclusive.  By default, the output element simply renders the plain text of the value attribute or the node indicated by the Single-Node Binding.  However, if the Single-Node Binding indicates a non-empty data node, and the media type is specified based on the mediatype attribute or mediatype child element, then the content of the data node must be decoded or dereferenced according to its datatype, and the result should be rendered according to the indicated media type if it is possible to do so (e.g. a voice-only device cannot render a digital image).   When the media type is specified, implementations may handle the output content as presentation-only or as interactive content, and interactive content may be isolated from or capable of accessing the enclosing document that contains the output.  Further implementation experience and user feedback is required.  For example, if the output content includes XForms user interface elements, it may be desirable for them to access a default XForms model in the output content or from the enclosing document. If the Single Node Binding is absent or if it does not indicate a non-empty instance node, then the media type specification is ignored if given.  Otherwise, if the Single Node Binding produces a non-empty node, and the media type is specified, then decoding or dereferencing of the instance node prior to rendition is performed by datatype as follows: If the instance node either is of type or is derived from type xsd:base64Binary, then the data is base-64 decoded. If the instance node either is of type or is derived from type xsd:hexBinary, then the data is hex-binary decoded. If the instance node either is of type or is derived from type xsd:anyURI, then the data is treated as a URI and dereferenced. If the instance node is of any other type, then the data is used without modification. If the output rendition is based on the value attribute, then the rendition is updated if the nodes referenced by the value expression change or if the content of any of the referenced nodes changes.  Otherwise, the rendition of an output is updated if the node referenced by the Single-Node Binding changes, if the content of the referenced node changes, or if the media type changes.  The media type can change by a change to the mediatype element's referenced node or its content (a host language may also allow DOM mutation of the content of the mediatype attribute or element).  A change to the label associated with the output causes an update to the rendition of the label (which may affect the layout position of the main output content). Data to be decoded does not conform to the format of xsd:base64Binary or xsd:hexBinary An error dereferencing the URI in a node of or derived from type xsd:anyURI A data format error (e.g. invalid or unsupported image format) An unrecognized media type identifier string The content model for the output element includes UI Common in order to allow action handlers for the xforms-output-error as well as to allow more comprehensive behavior and information to be provided for the output, e.g. via the hint element. Examples: A graphical browser might render an output form control as follows:    Given the model above, the following controls can upload an image to instance data and display it: A graphical browser may take into account the appearance and the localization information from the host language and present the above output form controls as follows: Lexical: 1998-01-19 Full: 19 janvier 1998 Minimal: 19/01/1998 Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Description: This form control enables the common feature found on Web sites to upload a file from the local file system, as well as accepting input from various devices including microphones, pens, and digital cameras. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional. Space-separated list of suggested media types, used by the XForms Processor to determine the possible sources of data to upload.  Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is false. Data Binding Restrictions: This form control can only be bound to datatypes xsd:anyURI, xsd:base64Binary or xsd:hexBinary, or types derived by restriction from these. This control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Implementation Requirements: For base64Binary or hexBinary data binding: When bound to an instance data node of type xsd:base64binary, xsd:hexBinary, or a type derived by restriction thereof, on activation upload places the binary content in the content of the node with the indicated encoding. Implementation Requirements: For anyURI data binding: When bound to an instance data node of type xsd:anyURI (or a type derived by restriction thereof), on activation upload places a URI in the content of the node. For security reasons, the XForms Processor must not dereference the URI bound to this form control without explicit user permission. Implementors note that upload must associate the binary content, mediatype, and filename with that URI for 11.9.6 Serialization as multipart/related and 11.9.7 Serialization as multipart/form-data serialization.  Implementations with a file system should support file upload&mdash;selecting a specific file. The types of files presented by default should reflect the mediatype specified by attribute mediatype, for example defaulting to only audio file types in the file dialog when the mediatype is "audio/*".  Implementation Requirements: For all data bindings: Implementations with specific pen/digitizer hardware should (and implementations with other pointing devices may) support scribble&mdash;allowing in-place creation of pen-based data.  Implementations with specific audio recording capabilities should support record audio&mdash;in-place recording of an audio clip.  Implementations with a digital camera, scanner interface or screen capture should support acquire image&mdash;in-place upload of images from an attached device.  Implementations with video recording capability should provide a record video option.  Implementations with 3d capabilities should provide a 3d interface option. Implementations may provide proprietary implementations (for example, a mediatype of text/rtf could invoke an edit window with a proprietary word processing application) Implementations are encouraged to support other input devices not mentioned here. Implementations which cannot support upload for the given mediatype must make this apparent to the user. See the child elements filename (8.1.6.1 The filename Element) and mediatype (8.1.6.2 The mediatype Element (for upload)).  Example: A graphical browser might render this form control as follows:    Implementation Requirements: On activation, if child element filename is present and a filename is available, upload places the filename of the data to upload in the instance at the node indicated by the binding attributes on child element filename. On activation, if child element mediatype is present and a mediatype is available, upload places the mediatype of the data to upload in the instance at the node indicated by the binding attributes on child element mediatype.  Binding attributes on author-optional element filename specify the location in the instance for the parent element upload, when activated, to place the filename for the chosen binary resource. For security reasons, upload must not take action due to any existing value of the node. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding Content: EMPTY In the following example, the user is prompted to select an image. When activated, upload places in mail/attachment either the binary data of the image or a URI for it, depending on the type declared for the mail/attachment. The filename, perhaps "me.jpg", is placed in the attribute node mail/attachment/@filename, and the mediatype, perhaps "image/jpeg" in the attribute node mail/attachment/@mediatype. Example: Binding attributes on author-optional element mediatype specify the location in the instance for the parent element upload, when activated, to place the mediatype of the chosen binary resource, if available. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding Content: EMPTY Description: This form control allows selection from a sequential range of values. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional attribute containing a  hint for the lexical starting bound for the range&mdash;a legal value for the underlying data. If provided, this value is used to further refine the constraints specified by the underlying model. Author-optional attribute containing a  hint for the ending bound for the range&mdash;a legal value for the underlying data. If provided, this value is used to further refine the constraints specified by the underlying model. Author-optional attribute containing a delta-value to use for incrementing or decrementing the value. Must be of a type capable of expressing the difference between two legal values of the underlying data. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is false. Data Binding Restrictions: Binds only the following list of datatypes, or datatypes derived by restriction from those in the list: xsd:duration, xsd:date, xsd:time, xsd:dateTime, xsd:gYearMonth, xsd:gYear, xsd:gMonthDay, xsd:gDay, xsd:gMonth, xsd:float,  xsd:double, and xsd:decimal. The above list of datatypes includes by derivation all of the integer datatypes (), all of the XForms datatypes defined in Section 5.2 XForms Datatypes that correspond to the allowed XML schema datatypes, and the datatypes defined in 5.2.4 xforms:dayTimeDuration and 5.2.5 xforms:yearMonthDuration. This control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Implementation Requirements: Must allow input of a value corresponding to the bound datatype. Implementations should inform the user of the upper and lower bounds, as well as the step size, if any. If the instance data value is outside the upper or lower bounds, this form control must indicate an out-of-range condition. In graphical environments, this form control may be rendered as a "slider" or "rotary control". In the event of overlapping restrictions between the underlying datatype and the start and end hints, the most restrictive range should be used. Notice that the attributes of this element encapsulate sufficient metadata that in conjunction with the type information available from the XForms Model proves sufficient to produce meaningful prompts when using modalities such as speech, e.g., when using an accessibility aid. Thus, in the example below, an aural user agent might speak a prompt of the form Please pick a date in the range January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001. Examples: A graphical browser might render this as follows:    Description: This form control is similar to the HTML element button and allows for user-triggered actions. This form control may also be used to construct other custom form controls. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any node. This form control does not directly interact with form data, but is affected by model item properties of the bound node, thus binding attributes are not required. Implementation Requirements: The user agent must provide a means to generate an DOMActivate event on the form control. Graphical implementations might render this form control as a push-button with the label on the button face. Style sheets can be used to style this form control as an image, hyperlink, or other presentation. "full": visually rendered as a standard button control with border."compact": visually rendered as a standard button control without border"minimal": rendered with no border, a transparent background and underline font effect.  This rendition hint is meant to be analogous to the typical visual rendition of an XHTML anchor element. Example: Description: This form control initiates a submission . Special Attributes: Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any node. This form control does not directly interact with form data, but is affected by model item properties of the bound node, thus binding attributes are not required. Example: Description: This form control allows the user to make multiple selections from a set of choices. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional attribute determining whether free entry is allowed in the list. Default is "closed". Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is true. Data Binding Restrictions: any simpleContent capable of holding a sequence. The restriction to binding simpleContent exists when the choices are authored as part of the user interface control as shown in this section. Element itemset (described in 9.3.6 The itemset Element) creates dynamic selection items and allows the available choices to be obtained from an XForms Model. When itemset uses the value element, the restriction to binding simpleContent remains in effect.  However, the itemset also allows for the selection and deselection of subtrees of instance data using the copy element, and when using that construct, the data binding restriction to simpleContent is relaxed, but the form control must bind to an element with no mixed content. Except in the case described above where the simpleContent data binding restriction is relaxed, this control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. A limitation of the XML Schema list datatypes is that white space characters in the storage values (the value element) are always interpreted as separators between individual data values. Therefore, authors should avoid using white space characters within storage values with list simpleContent. When selected, this item would introduce not one but four additional selection values: "America", "of", "States", and "United". Implementation Requirements: The label for each choice must be presented, and the control must  allow any number of selections, possibly none. When this form control uses the value element for selection, it   stores the values corresponding to the selected choices in a space separated list in the location addressed by the binding attributes. The values to be stored for selected items  are either directly specified as the contents of element value, or specified indirectly through binding attributes on element value. When this form control uses the copy element for selection, it stores copies of the subtrees corresponding to the selected choices in the location addressed by the binding attributes.  The datatype bound to this form control may include a non-enumerated value space, e.g., xsd:string, or a union of a enumeration and a non-enumerated datatype (called an open enumeration). In this case, control select may have attribute selection="open". The form control must then allow free data entry, as described in 8.1.2 The input Element. The form control may permit multiple values to be entered through free entry. For closed selections: If the  instance data matches the storage data of one or more of the selection items, those items are selected. If there is no match, no items are initially selected. If any of the stored values or subtree copies do not correspond to an item  with a matching storage value or subtree, the form control must indicate an out-of-range condition.  If the form control switches to or from being out-of-range, then xforms-out-of-range or xforms-in-range must be dispatched to the form control. For open selections: When using dynamic selections with the itemset and copy elements, open selection has no effect.  If the  instance data matches the storage values specified by one or more of the selection items, then all such matching items are selected. If any instance data list values do not match the storage value specified by one or more of the items, all such non-matching values are retained, as if entered through free entry. Free entry text is handled the same as form control input (8.1.2 The input Element), possibly in multiplicity.  For both closed and open selections, any selection item with an empty storage data subtree or a storage value that is either empty or contains only white space characters must remain deselected. Implementation Hints:  An accessibility aid might allow the user to browse through the available choices and leverage the grouping of choices in the markup to provide enhanced navigation through long lists of choices. "full": all choices should be rendered at all times."compact": a fixed number of choices should be rendered, with scrolling facilities as needed"minimal": a minimum number of choices should be rendered, with a facility to temporarily render additional choices Example: In the above example, more than one flavor can be selected. A graphical browser might render form control select as any of the following: Description: This form control allows the user to make a single selection from multiple choices. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional attribute determining whether free entry is allowed in the list. Default is "closed". Author-optional. When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is true. Data Binding Restrictions: Binds to any simpleContent. The restriction to binding simpleContent exists when the choices are authored as part of the user interface control as shown in this section. Element itemset (described in 9.3.6 The itemset Element) creates dynamic selection items and allows the available choices to be obtained from an XForms Model. When itemset uses the value element, the restriction to binding simpleContent remains in effect.  However, the itemset also allows for the selection and deselection of subtrees of instance data using the copy element, and when using that construct, the data binding restriction to simpleContent is relaxed, but the form control must bind to an element with no mixed content. Except in the case described above where the simpleContent data binding restriction is relaxed, this control cannot bind to element nodes that have element children.  See 8.1.1 Implementation Requirements Common to All Form Controls for user interface processing rules common to all form controls. Implementation Requirements: The label for each choice must be presented, and the control must  allow at all times exactly one selection. When this form control uses the value element for selection, it   stores the value corresponding to the selected choice in the location addressed by the binding attributes. The value to be stored is either directly specified as the contents of element value, or specified indirectly through binding attributes on element value. When this form control uses the copy element for selection, it stores a copy of the subtree corresponding to the selected choice in the location addressed by the binding attributes.  The datatype bound to this form control may include a non-enumerated value space, e.g., xsd:string, or a union of a enumeration and a non-enumerated datatype (called an open enumeration). In this case, control select1 may have attribute selection="open". The form control must then allow free-form data entry, as described in 8.1.2 The input Element.  For closed selections: If the  instance data matches the storage data of one of the selection items, that item is selected. If there is no match, no items are initially selected. If there is no match and the storage data is non-empty, the form control must indicate an out-of-range condition.  If the form control switches to or from being out-of-range, then xforms-out-of-range or xforms-in-range must be dispatched to the form control. For open selections: When using dynamic selections with the itemset and copy elements, open selection has no effect.  If the  instance data matches the storage value specified by one of the selection items, then the first such matching item is selected. Otherwise, no items are selected and the instance data value is retained, as if entered through free text entry. Free entry text is handled the same as form control input (8.1.2 The input Element). For both closed and open selections, any selection item with a storage value which is empty or which contains only white space characters must remain deselected. Implementation Hints:  An accessibility aid might allow the user to browse through the available choices and leverage the grouping of choices in the markup to provide enhanced navigation through long lists of choices.  User interfaces may choose to render this form control as a pulldown list or group of radio buttons, among other options. The appearance attribute offers a hint as to which rendering might be most appropriate, although any styling information (such as CSS) should take precedence. Example:  In the above example, selecting one of the choices will result in the associated value given by element value on the selected item being set in the underlying instance data at the location icecream/flavor.  A graphical browser might render this form control as any of the following:  The child elements detailed below provide the ability to attach metadata to many form controls and other elements. Factoring all human readable messages to a separate resource XML file. Using URIs into this XML resource bundle within individual label elements Finally, an XForms implementation could use content negotiation to obtain the appropriate XML resource bundle, e.g., based on the accept-language headers from the client, to serve up the user interface with messages localized to the client's locale. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: None The label specified can exist in instance data or as inline text. If more than one source of label is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes,  inline text. An accessibility aid might speak the metadata encapsulated here when the containing form control gets focus.  The author-optional element help provides a convenient way to attach help information to a form control.  Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: None The message specified can exist in instance data or as inline text. If more than one source of message is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes,  inline text. An example of this element is at 10.16 The message Element.  The author-optional element hint provides a convenient way to attach hint information to a form control.  Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: None The message specified can exist in instance data or as inline text. If more than one source of message is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes,  inline text. An example of this element is at 10.16 The message Element.  The author-optional element alert provides a convenient way to attach alert or error information to a form control. Rendering of this element is implementation-defined, and there is no default level such as modal or ephemeral for the displayed message. Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: None The message specified can exist in instance data or as inline text. If more than one source of message is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes,  inline text. See G XForms and Styling for examples to see how this might be presented to the user. This element is used within selection form controls to group available choices. This provides the same functionality as element optgroup in HTML. Common Attributes: Common  This element specifies the storage value and label to represent an item in a list. It is found within elements select1 and select, or grouped in element choices. Common Attributes: Common the value of a node indicated by a single node binding expression, if specified the result of evaluating an XPath expression appearing in attribute value, if specified the inline content of the value element (when neither the single node binding nor the value attribute are expressed). Special Attributes: Data Binding Restriction: All lexical values must be valid according to the datatype bound to the selection control. If the single node binding attributes are used and indicate a node in a model other than the bound node of the containing selection control, then an xforms-binding-exception must occur. Aggregation of form controls with markup defined in this chapter provides semantics about the relationship among user interface controls; such knowledge can be useful in delivering a coherent UI to small devices. For example, if the user interface needs to be split up over several screens, controls appearing inside the same aggregation would typically be rendered on the same screen or page. A group element is a container form control that allows a form author to aggregate other form controls into a single, aggregate user interface component.  The elements and attributes included in this module are: the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to empty nodeset, the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to a non-relevant instance node, the group is contained by a non-relevant switch or group (which includes a non-relevant repeat object), or the group is contained by a non-selected case element of a switch. Example: Setting the input focus on a group results in the focus being set to the first form control in the navigation order within that group. A switch element is a container form control that allows the creation of user interfaces where the user interface can be varied based on user actions and events. The elements and attributes included in this module are:  This element contains one or more case elements, any one of which is rendered at a given time. This is separate from XForms relevant processing (see 6.1.4 The relevant Property), which is based on the current state of the XForms Model. As an example, portions of a questionnaire pertaining to the user's automobile may become relevant only if the user has answered in the affirmative to the question 'Do you own a car?'. Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Example: The above results in the portion of the user interface contained in the first case being displayed initially. This prompts for the user's name; filling in a value and activating the control e.g., by pressing enter results switches to the alternate case, with a read-only output rendering. Activating the trigger labeled "Edit" in turn switches back to the original case. Common Attributes: Common Special Attributes: Author-optional selection status for the case. The default value is "false". If multiple cases within a switch are marked as selected="true", the first selected case remains and all others are deselected. If none are selected, the first becomes selected.  The XForms specification allows the definition of repeating structures such as multiple items within a purchase order. When defining the XForms Model, such higher-level collections are constructed out of basic building blocks; similarly, this section defines a  container form control called  repeat that can bind to data structures such as lists and collections and provide a user interface for each node of the list or collection.. The elements and attributes included in this module are: For example:  Common Attributes: Common, UI Common, Node Set Binding Special Attributes: Author-optional 1-based initial value of the repeat index. The default value is 1. Author-optional hint to the XForms Processor as to how many elements from the collection to display.  This element operates over a  repeat collection  by binding the encapsulated user interface controls to each element of the collection. If an element of the collection is non-relevant, then the rendering approach used to signify non-relevance is applied to the associated user interface controls. Attributes on this element specify how many members of the collection are presented to the user at any given time. XForms Actions insert, delete, and setindex can be used to operate on the collection&mdash;see 10 XForms Actions. Another way to view repeat processing (disregarding special user interface interactions) is to consider "unrolling" the repeat. The above example is similar to the following (given four item elements in the returned node-set):  The form controls appearing inside repeat need to be suitable for populating individual items of the collection. A simple but powerful consequence of the above is that if the XForms Model specifies nested collections, then a corresponding user interface can nest repeat elements.   It is possible to nest repeat elements to create more powerful user interface for editing structured data. H.2 Editing Hierarchical Bookmarks Using XForms is an example of a form using nested repeats to edit hierarchical data consisting of bookmarks within multiple sections. Consider the following insert statement that appears as part of that example.   The above insert statement is used in that example to add new bookmark entries into the currently selected section. The inner (nested) repeat operates on bookmarks in this selected section; The index&mdash;as returned by XForms function index&mdash;for this inner repeat starts at 1. Hence, after a new empty section of bookmarks is created and becomes current, the first insert bookmark operation adds the newly created bookmark at the front of the list.  The markup contained within the body of element repeat specifies the user interface to be generated for each repeat item of the underlying repeat collection. During user interface initialization (see 4.2.2 The xforms-model-construct-done Event), the following steps are performed for repeat: The Node Set Binding is evaluated to locate the  repeat collection  to be operated on by this repeat.  The index for this repeating structure is initialized to the value of startindex. If the initial startindex is less than 1 it defaults to 1. If the index is greater than the initial node-set then it defaults to the size of the node-set.  User interface as specified by the repeat is generated for the requisite number of members of the collection as specified by attributes on element repeat.  A new repeat item is created dynamically at any time in the lifecycle of the form (i.e. any time after xforms-model-construct-done) whenever a new node is added to the repeat collection.  There are many ways to add new nodes to a repeat collection, including but not limited to the following:  An insert action can add one or more nodes that match the repeat nodeset; The new instance data subtree created by a submission instance replacement may contain nodes that match the repeat nodeset; A setvalue action or a calculate may change a value that causes one or more nodes to match the repeat nodeset. Any time a new repeat item is created, XML Event handlers declared within the corresponding repeat object are initialized, and the user interface form controls generated for the repeat object are initialized in the same manner as the user interface initialization that is performed during default processing of xforms-model-construct-done.  For example, if the repeat object contains an inner repeat run-time object, then it is initialized according to the list of steps at the beginning of this section (9.3.3 Repeat Processing).  The processing model for repeating structures includes an index that points to the current repeat item in the  repeat collection . This repeat index is accessed via XForms function index (7.7.5 The index() Function) and manipulated via XForms Action setindex (10.5 The setindex Element). This index can be used as a reference point for insert and delete actions. Notice that the contained XForms form controls inside element repeat do not explicitly specify the index of the collection entry being populated. This is intentional; it keeps both authoring as well as the processing model simple. If one or more nodes have been added to the repeat collection by an insert action, then the repeat items corresponding to the new nodes must be created and initialized, and the repeat index must be updated to indicate the repeat item corresponding to the last node added by the insert.   The change of index on a repeat does not cause the index of any repeat nested within it to be re-initialized. The repeat item generation and repeat index update on insertion must behave as if it occurs in response to the xforms-insert event dispatched by the insert action.  The index update must behave as if it occurs when the xforms-insert event reaches the parent of the  target instance element in the capture phase. An event handler that listens for xforms-insert on instance in the default phase has access to the updated index value via function index().    A repeat item can also be destroyed dynamically at any time in the lifecycle of the form whenever a node is removed from the repeat collection.  When a repeat item is destroyed, the repeat object and all of its inner form controls are eliminated, including inner repeats, switches and groups, and all XML Event handlers created by the repeat object are eliminated.  There are many ways to remove repeat items from a repeat collection, including but not limited to the following:  A delete action can remove nodes that matched the repeat nodeset; The new instance data subtree created by a submission instance replacement may replace nodes that matched the repeat nodeset; A setvalue action or a calculate may change a value that causes one or more nodes to stop matching the repeat nodeset. If one or more nodes have been removed from the repeat collection by a delete action, then the repeat items corresponding to the deleted nodes must be destroyed and the repeat index must be updated based on the rules below.   The change of index on a repeat does not cause the index of any repeat nested within it to be re-initialized. The repeat index update on deletion behaves as if it occurs in response to the xforms-delete event dispatched by the delete action.  Specifically, the index update behaves as if it occurs when the xforms-delete event reaches the parent of the  target instance element in the capture phase.  Element repeat enables the binding of user interaction to a node-set, referred to as  repeat collection. The number of displayed items might be less than the total number available in the collection. In this case, the presentation would render only a portion of the repeating items at a given time. For example, a graphical user interface might present a scrolling table. The current item indicated by the repeat index should be made available to the user at all times, for example, not allowed to scroll out of view. The XForms Actions enumerated at 10 XForms Actions may be used within event listeners to manipulate the  repeat collection  being populated by scrolling, inserting, and deleting entries.  Notice that the markup encapsulated by element repeat acts as the template for the user interface that is presented to the user. As a consequence, statically authored IDREF attributes must be interpreted based on a combination of repeat indexes and where the IDREF attributes appear relative to the element bearing the matching ID. Based on the IDREF resolution rules given in 4.7 Resolving ID References in XForms, it is possible to toggle the case of a switch even when it is within one or more repeat elements.  Similarly, it is possible to set the focus to controls and dispatch events to elements that are within one or more repeat elements. If the focus is transferred to a form control within a repeat by any means, such as by an XForms action or by user interaction, the index of the repeat is updated to indicate the item of the  repeat collection  that contains the control. If the repeat item containing the focused control contains any inner repeat objects, their indexes are not changed. However,   the repeat index update is recursive for all outer repeats that contain the focused control; the index of each outer containing repeat is adjusted appropriately. These changes of repeat index occurs as if by invoking the setindex action.  Element repeat enables the creation of user interfaces for populating repeating structures. When using XForms within host languages like XHTML, it is often necessary to create repeating structures within constructs such as table. Thus, one might wish to use element repeat within a table to create the rows of a table, where each row of the table binds to a distinct member of a repeat collection. Since html:table doesn't  (and perhaps  never will) allow xforms:repeat elements as children, another syntax is needed. More generally, there is a need to integrate repeat behavior into host languages at points where the content model of the host language does not or cannot provide the appropriate extension hooks via modularization. To accommodate this, XForms defines an alternative syntax that is functionally equivalent to the repeat element, using the following attributes:   repeat-model  repeat-bind  repeat-nodeset  repeat-startindex  repeat-number    The above attributes are equivalent to the repeat attributes of the same name, but without the prefix repeat-. A host language can include these attributes in the appropriate places to enable repeating constructs. For example, a version of XHTML might use: Which could be validated against an appropriately configured XHTML Schema that includes the XForms Repeat module. Note that what gets repeated is the child elements of the element with the repeat- attributes. Additionally, when using XForms Action setindex, attribute repeat of type idref can point to any element carrying the repeat attributes. Similarly, when using function index against a repeating structure created via the repeat-attributes, the id of that element can be used as the argument to function index. This element allows the creation of dynamic selections within controls select and select1, where the available choices are determined at run-time. The node-set that holds the available choices is specified via the Node Set Binding. Child elements label and value indirectly specify the label and storage values. Notice that the run-time effect of itemset is the same as using element choices with child item elements  to statically author the available choices. For each node of the Node Set Binding, an associated item element is created.  XForms Actions appearing in the content of an itemset are created within each item element, and the in-scope evaluation context for these XForms Actions is based on the node for which the item was generated as described in Section 7.2 Evaluation Context.  As with the repeat element, the itemset template content, including XForms Actions, is made unavailable.  Copies of the itemset template content, including XForms Actions, are made available via repeated item objects.  Common Attributes: Common, Node Set Binding Whenever a refresh event is dispatched the nodeset is re-evaluated to update the list of available choices.  The following example shows element itemset within control select to specify a dynamic list of ice cream flavors: Structurally, this element is similar to 8.3.3 The value Element. It differs in that it can only be used within itemset, and that it works with subtrees of instance data rather than simple values.  Common Attributes: Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) If the single node binding attributes indicate a node in a model other than the bound node of the containing selection control, then an xforms-binding-exception must occur.. When a copy item is  selected, the following rules apply: The target node, selected by the binding attributes on the list form control, must be an element node, otherwise an exception results (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). The element node associated with the item, selected by the binding attributes on copy, is deep copied as a child of the target node  by using  an insert action  (10.3 The insert Element). A full computational dependency rebuild is done, followed by recalculate, revalidate, and refresh. When a copy item is deselected, the following rules apply: The target node, selected by the binding attributes on the list form control, must be an element node, otherwise an exception results (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). The child element node associated with the item, selected by the binding attributes on copy, is deleted  by using  a delete action  (10.4 The delete Element). A full computational dependency rebuild, followed by recalculate, revalidate, and refresh. If the target node of the select or select1 is readonly, then the insertion or deletion associated with the copy operation is not performed. This chapter defines the controller layer of XForms,  an XML Events-based [XML Events] common set of actions that can be invoked in response to events.  XForms itself defines no method for script-based event handling. The definition of such facilities is a responsibility of the hosting language.  All form controls as well as other elements defined in this specification have a set of common behaviors that encourage consistent authoring and look and feel for XForms-based applications. This consistency comes from attaching a common set of behaviors to the various form controls. In conjunction with the event binding mechanism provided by XML Events, these handlers provide a flexible means for forms authors to specify event processing at appropriate points within the XForms user interface. XForms Actions are declarative XML event handlers that capture high-level semantics. As a consequence, they significantly enhance the accessibility of XForms-based applications in comparison to previous Web technologies that relied exclusively on scripting. The elements and attributes included in this module are: The following group of attributes, here called Action Common, are available to all Action elements: Author-optional attribute defined in Section 10.17 Conditional Execution of XForms Actions. Author-optional attribute defined in Section 10.18 Iteration of XForms Actions. The following example shows how events can be used: This example recreates the behavior of the HTML reset control, which this specification does not define as an independent form control.  For each built-in XForms Action, this chapter lists the following: NameCommon AttributesSpecial AttributesDescription of behavior All elements defined in this chapter explicitly allow global attributes from the XML Events namespace, and apply the processing defined in that specification in section 2.3 [XML Events]. By default, the behavior of an action handler is performed one time when the action is encountered in the execution sequence.  However, execution of an action handler may be conditional or iterated, as described in 10.17 Conditional Execution of XForms Actions and 10.18 Iteration of XForms Actions. Execution of an outermost action handler begins by setting the XForms processor into the state of executing an outermost action handler.  The outermost action handler is then performed, which may include the execution of inner action handlers.  Finally, the XForms processor is set into the state of not executing an outermost action handler and then the deferred update is performed for each model.  The XForms processor is not considered to be executing an outermost action handler at the time that it performs deferred update behavior for XForms models.  Therefore, event handlers for events dispatched to the user interface during the deferred refresh behavior are considered to be new outermost action handler. Actions that manipulate properties of the XForms view layer begin by invoking the deferred update behavior so that the model and all data are up to date prior to performing the action.  The XForms Actions in this category are: setfocustogglesetindex Actions that directly invoke rebuild, recalculate, revalidate, or refresh always have an immediate effect, and clear the corresponding deferred update flag. The XForms Actions in this category are: rebuildrecalculaterevalidaterefresh Similarly, if the default processing of any of the events xforms-rebuild, xforms-recalculate, xforms-revalidate, or xforms-refresh are performed, then the corresponding deferred update flag is cleared.  The XForms Actions that can dispatch these events are:  resetdispatch XForms Actions that change the tree structure of instance data result in setting all four deferred update flags to true  for the model over which they operate. The XForms Actions in this category are: insertdelete XForms Actions that change only the value of an instance node results in setting the deferred update flags for recalculate, revalidate, and refresh to true and making no change to the deferred update flag for rebuild  for the model over which they operate. The XForms Actions in this category are: setvaluesetindex Finally, the XForms submission process can affect deferred update behavior.  See Section 11.2 The xforms-submit Event for details. XForms actions that are capable of initiating an XForms submission are: senddispatch This action causes its child actions to be invoked in the order that they are specified in the document. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common, Single Node Binding Special Attributes: The element content of setvalue specifies the literal value to set; this is an alternative to specifying a computed value via attribute value. If neither a value attribute nor text content are present, the effect is to set the value of the selected node to the empty string (""). If both are present, the value attribute is used. The following  examples contrast these approaches: This causes the string value at a/b/c in the instance data to be placed on the single node selected by the bind element with id="put-here". This causes the value "literal string" to be placed on the single node selected by the bind element with id="put-here". All strings are inserted into the instance data as follows: Attribute nodes: The string-value of the attribute is replaced with a string corresponding to the new value. Text nodes: The text node is replaced with a new one corresponding to the new value, or the text node is eliminated if the new value is the empty string. Namespace, processing instruction, and comment nodes: behavior is undefined (implementation-dependent). the XPath root node: an xforms-binding-exception occurs.  This action affects deferred updates by setting the deferred update flags for recalculate, revalidate and refresh. Special Attributes: The XForms action system's deferred update flags for rebuild, recalculate, revalidate and refresh are set.  This action affects deferred updates by setting the deferred update flags for rebuild, recalculate, revalidate and refresh. Examples: See 10.4 The delete Element for an example that uses insert and delete to make a repeat that always shows at least one repeat item. See Appendix B Patterns for Data Mutations for numerous further usage patterns for sevalue,  insert and delete. This action deletes one or more nodes from instance data. Special Attributes:  This action affects deferred updates by setting the deferred update flags for rebuild, recalculate, revalidate and refresh. Examples:  See Appendix B Patterns for Data Mutations for numerous further usage patterns for sevalue,  insert and delete. Special Attributes: Required reference to a repeating element. If the selected index is 0 or less, an xforms-scroll-first event is dispatched and the index is set to 1. If the selected index is greater than the index of the last repeat item, an xforms-scroll-last event is dispatched and the index is set to that of the last item. If the index evaluates to NaN the action has no effect.   This action affects deferred updates by performing deferred update in its initialization and by setting the deferred update flags for recalculate, revalidate and refresh. This action  performs the following: Dispatches an xforms-deselect event to the currently selected case  in the switch containing the identified case. Adjusts the selected states (not the attribute values) on the affected cases to reflect the new state of the switch containing the identified case. Dispatches an xform-select event to the case just selected. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common Special Attributes: The case to be selected by the switch is identified by IDREF either by the attribute case or by a child case element. If no case element contains the given identifier, then this action has no effect.  This action affects deferred updates by performing deferred update in its initialization.

Two kinds of event can be dispatched:  Predefined XForms events (i.e., xforms-event-name), in which case the bubbles and cancelable attributes are ignored and the standard semantics as defined in 4 Processing Model apply. An event created by the XForms author with no predefined XForms semantics and as such not handled by default by the XForms Processor.

This action results in the XForms user interface being refreshed, and the presentation of user interface controls being updated to reflect the state of the underlying instance data&mdash;see 4.3.4 The xforms-refresh Event. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common Special Attributes:  This action affects deferred updates. This action initiates reset processing by dispatching an xforms-reset event to the specified model. Processing of event xforms-reset is defined in the processing model&mdash;see 4.3.5 The xforms-reset Event. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common Special Attributes:  This action affects deferred updates. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common, Single-Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: Author-optional attribute. Link to an external resource to load. Author-optional link behavior specifier. The allowed values are "replace" and "new". If this attribute is missing, a default value of "replace" is assumed. The document is loaded into a new presentation context, e.g., a new window. Form processing in the original window continues. The document is loaded into the current window. Form processing is interrupted, exactly as if the user had manually requested navigating to a new document. Common Attributes: None Special Attributes: Content: PCDATA This action initiates submit processing by dispatching an xforms-submit event. Processing of event xforms-submit is defined in the processing model&mdash;see 4.3.9 The xforms-submit Event. Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common Special Attributes: Common Attributes: Common, Events, Action Common, Single Node Binding (author-optional) Special Attributes: The message specified can exist in instance data or as inline text. If more than one source of message is specified in this element, the order of precedence is: single node binding attributes,  inline text. The user interface for the message action is considered to be created at the time the action occurs.  If the message is obtained from the inline content of the message action, then the output of any output controls in the message content is determined based on the instance data available when the message action occurs.  For example, the following example displays the message Hello, world! as the form starts up: In this example, the message includes the latest user input even though other form controls not in the message action are not guaranteed to be updated until the end of the xforms-refresh event processing: Due to deferred update behavior, if a message action is preceded in an action sequence by other actions that change instance nodes, and the message references nodes that are computationally dependent on the changed nodes, then the form author should invoke the recalculate action before the message action. Moreover, if the computational dependencies involved nodes that were inserted or deleted, then the form author should invoke rebuild prior to the recalculate. A graphical browser might render a modal message as follows:   A modeless message is the foundation for displaying a help message, which a graphical browser might render as follows:    An ephemeral message is the foundation for displaying a hint message, which a graphical browser might render as follows:    In actions insert and delete, the attribute context is evaluated before the if attribute. Counter and accumlator variables are created in instance data to sum a selection of values chosen by the user XForms is designed to gather instance data, serialize it into an external representation, and submit it with a protocol. XForms defines a set of options for serialization and submission. The following sections define the processing of instance data for submission, and the behavior for the serialization and submission options. The submission element represents declarative instructions on what to submit, and how.

Common Attributes: Common Special Attributes: Author-optional selector binding expression enabling submission of a portion of the instance data. The selected node, and all descendants, are selected for submission. The default value is "/". Author-optional reference to a bind element. When present, the binding reference on this attribute is used in preference to any binding reference from the ref attribute. Author-optional boolean attribute that indicates whether or not the data validation checks of the submission are performed. The default value is "false" if the value of serialization is "none" and "true" otherwise. Author-optional boolean attribute that indicates whether or not the relevance pruning of the submission is performed. The default value is "false" if the value of serialization is "none" and "true" otherwise. Author-optional attribute specifying the version of XML to be serialized. The default is "1.0". Author-optional attribute specifying whether the serializer should add extra white space nodes for readability. The default is "false". Author-optional attribute specifying the mediatype for XML  serialization  of instance data. Authors should ensure that the type specified is compatible with the data being submitted, such as application/xml for posted XML data. The default is "application/xml". This attribute does not affect serialization and cannot be used to override the serialization attribute.  It is only used to provide additional information about the submission data serialization when the serialization is application/xml.  For example, this attribute could be used to indicate that the content type of the XML serialization is text/xml. Author-optional attribute specifying an encoding for serialization. The default is "UTF-8". Author-optional attribute specifying whether to omit the XML declaration on the serialized instance data. The default value is "false". Author-optional attribute specifying whether to include a standalone declaration in the serialized XML.If the omit-xml-declaration attribute has the value true, then this attribute is ignored.  Otherwise, if this attribute is omitted, then the XML declaration does not include a standalone document declaration, and if this attribute is specified, then the XML declaration includes a standalone document declaration with the same value as this attribute. Author-optional attribute specifying element names to be serialized with CDATA sections. The default is empty string. Author-optional attribute providing control over namespace serialization. If absent, all namespace nodes present in the instance data are considered for serialization. If present, specifies list of namespace prefixes to consider for serialization, in addition to those visibly utilized. As in [Exc-C14N], the special value #default specifies the default namespace. The following examples show how various options on element submission can affect serialization as application/xml. Given the following XForms fragment: Note that the includenamespaceprefixes attribute is not present, which causes all namespace nodes to be serialized, resulting in the following serialized instance data: In particular, note that the XForms namespace has been serialized. To prevent this example from including the unneeded XForms namespace while maintaining the needed my prefix, includenamespaceprefixes="my" must be added to the submission element. When this attribute is present, the author takes responsibility to list all namespace prefixes not visibly utilized by the submitted instance data. The following attributes correspond (in spelling, processing, and default values) to attributes on the output element of [XSLT 1.0], with the exception of using xsd:boolean to replace "yes"|"no": versionindentencodingomit-xml-declarationcdata-section-elements The following XSLT attributes have no counterpart in XForms: doctype-systemdoctype-public The table below provides an overview of the child elements of the XForms submission element, including their attributes and content models. Elements defined in the XForms Actions module are also allowed in the content model of submission. Target: submission Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: Yes Context Info: None Otherwise, the default action for this event results in the following steps: The submission method is determined. The submission resource is determined. If the resource is not specified, then submission processing stops after dispatching even xforms-submit-error with context information containing an error-type of resource-error. The response returned from the submission is applied as follows:  Behaviors of other possible values for attribute replace are not defined in this specification. In addition to initiating a submission with its default processing, XForms actions can also provide handlers for the xforms-submit event to peform tasks such as data preparation. Example:  The schema for the doctor search service requires certain portions of the patient record in order to provide a list of specialists who could treat the patient.  The server-side module may perform database searches for doctors with the required specialties as well as implement business rules such as providing doctors that are within an acceptable distance of the given city. The resulting list is provided to a separate instance so it can be presented to the user for selection or used in subsequent availability searches. Dispatched at the beginning of submission serialization (see 11.2 The xforms-submit Event). Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: Since the submission-body is a string, this feature may be used to submit non-XML data. Example:  The string value of the element my/text is placed into the node representing the submission body, so that is the text posted by the submission.  In this example, the result returned by the submission replaces the document.  This feature could be used to submit plain text, but it could also be used to allow a document to submit its serialization rather than just submitting instance data. Dispatched as an indication of: successful completion of a submission process Target: submission Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info:  Default Action: None; notification event only. Example:  Dispatched as an indication of: failure of a submission process Target: submission Bubbles: Yes Cancelable: No Context Info: Default Action: None; notification event only. Example:  The submission resource is the URI for the submission.  It is of type xsd:anyURI. The resource element allows the URI used for a submission to be dynamically calculated based on instance data.   Common Attributes: None Special Attributes: Content: PCDATA Example:  The submission method indicates the submission protocol operation to be performed. The method element allows the submission method to be dynamically calculated based on instance data. Common Attributes: None Special Attributes: Content: PCDATA Common Attributes: None Special Attributes: document order of header elements node order of nodes in nodeset attribute document order of value elements The application of this order information to header serialization is determined by the submission protocol. Example:  In the example below, the submission request uses the header element to replace the user agent's existing value of the HTTP Accept header with application/sparql-results+xml. Common Attributes: None Special Attributes: Common Attributes: None Special Attributes: the submission resource the submission method the header elements Other bindings, in particular to the URI scheme "mailto:" may, and the schemes "https:" and "file:" should, be supported. Bindings to these schemes are not normatively defined in XForms. Implementations that choose to provide a binding to these schemes should pay particular attention to privacy and security concerns. Within the "http:" and "https:" schemes, form creators are encouraged to follow the finding of the W3C Technical Architecture Group on when to use the GET method: [TAG Finding 7] The submission method determines the default data serialization format, and both the submission method and the URI scheme in the submission resource determine the submission protocol operation, according to the following table: Foreign-namespaced attribute values are allowed in the Submission Method, but no behavior is defined by XForms. This submit method represents HTTP GET or the equivalent concept. The serialized form data is delivered as part of the URI that is requested during the submit process. This method is not suitable for submission of forms that are intended to change state or cause other actions to take place at the server. See [RFC 2616] for recommended uses of HTTP GET. The URI is constructed as follows: The submit URI is examined. If it does not already contain a ? (question mark) character, one is appended. If it does already contain a question mark character and the serialized form data is non-empty, then a separator character from the attribute separator is appended. The serialized form data, if any,  is appended to the URI. No message body is sent with the request. Examples:  These submit methods represent HTTP POST or the equivalent concept (such as a mail message). The serialized form data is delivered as the message body. Examples: Submits the XML for a purchase order to a secure server order processing system. This submit method represents HTTP PUT or the equivalent concept (such as writing to a local file). The serialized form data is delivered as the message body. Example: This format permits the expression of the instance data as XML that is straightforward to process with off-the-shelf XML processing tools. In addition, this format is capable of submission of binary content. The steps for serialization are as follows: An XML document is produced following the rules of the XML output method defined in [XSLT 1.0] section 16 and 16.1, using the values supplied as attributes of the submission element. Handling of namespace nodes: The default behavior is that every namespace node is serialized according to the rules of the XML output method, so that at least one namespace declaration appears in the serialized XML for each in-scope namespace. Additional inherited namespaces are declared on the root element of the serialized XML. If, however, attribute includenamespaceprefixes on element submission is present, then all namespace declarations not visibly utilized in the instance data (as defined in [Exc-C14N]) and the default namespace if it is empty are excluded from the root element serialization, unless the corresponding namespace prefix is listed in the includenamespaceprefixes attribute. The special value #default represents the default namespace.  Mediatype: By default, the mediatype of the serialized XML instance is application/xml, but can be changed to a compatible type using element submission attribute mediatype. Authors should ensure that the type specified is compatible with application/xml. This format is intended for integration of XForms into environments that involve large amounts of binary data where the inclusion of the data as xsd:base64Binary or xsd:hexBinary is undesirable. In this format, XML instance data is serialized as one part of the [RFC 2387] multipart/related message, using the rules as described in 11.9.5 Serialization as application/xml. Binary content from xsd:anyURI instance nodes populated by the upload (see 8.1.6 The upload Element) control is serialized in separate parts of the [RFC 2387] multipart/related message. This format follows the rules of multipart/related MIME data streams for in [RFC 2387], with specific requirements of this serialization listed below: multipart/related message header requirements: Must contain a type parameter of the mediatype of the serialized XML instance. Must contain a start parameter referring to the Content-ID first body part (root). First body part (root) requirements: Must have Content-Type parameter of the type specified by the submission mediatype attribute. Content is serialized by the rules at 11.9.5 Serialization as application/xml. Subsequent part requirements: One part for each node with a datatype of xsd:anyURI populated by upload with: A Content-Type header that represents the type of the attachment if known, otherwise application/octet-stream. A Content-Transfer-Encoding header. A Content-ID header whose value matches the URI in the associated instance data node. The binary content associated with the URI, serialized according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding heading. Submits the instance data in multipart/related, along with the selected file as an attachment. This format is for legacy compatibility to permit the use of XForms clients with [RFC 2388] servers. This method is suitable for the persistence of binary content. Contextual path information, attribute values, namespaces and namespace prefixes are not preserved. As a result, different elements might serialize to the same name. Existing HTML user agents fail to encode special characters (such as double quotes) and non-ASCII characters in the Content-Disposition: form-data name and filename parameters. Since this serialization method is supported for legacy applications only, new applications should use application/xml or multipart/related.  This format follows the rules for multipart/form-data MIME data streams in [RFC 2388], with specific requirements of this serialization listed below: Each element node is visited in document order, except non-relevant elements are skipped if the relevant setting of the submission is true. Each visited element that has no child element nodes (i.e., each leaf element node) is selected for inclusion, including those that have no value (no text node). Element nodes selected for inclusion are  encoded as Content-Disposition: form-data MIME parts as defined in [RFC 2388], with the name parameter being the element local name. Element nodes of any datatype populated by upload also have a Content-Disposition filename parameter, if the filename is available.  Element nodes of any datatype not populated by upload are serialized as the string value of the element (the concatenation of all text node children, or empty string if the element has no text node children). The Content-Type must be text/plain except for xsd:anyURI, xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary, and derived types, in which case the header represents the media type of the attachment if known, otherwise application/octet-stream. If a character set is applicable, the Content-Type may have a charset parameter. Example: Submits the instance data in multipart/form-data, along with the selected file as a part. This format represents an extension of the [XHTML 1.0] form content type application/x-www-form-urlencoded with specific rules for encoding non-ASCII and reserved characters. This format is not suitable for the persistence of binary content. Therefore, it is recommended that forms capable of containing binary content use another serialization method. The steps for serialization are as follows: Element nodes selected for inclusion are encoded as EltName=value, where = is a literal character, EltName represents the element local name, and value represents the string value of the element (the concatenation of all text node children, or empty string if the element has no text node children). The separator character {sep} from the separator attribute on submission is used between pairs of encoded name/value pairs, e.g. EltName1=value1{sep}EltName2=value2{sep}EltName3=value3. Note that contextual path information is not preserved, nor are namespaces or namespace prefixes. As a result, different elements might serialize to the same name. The encoding of EltName and value are as follows: space characters are replaced by +, and then non-ASCII and reserved characters (as defined by [RFC 2396] as amended by subsequent documents in the IETF track) are escaped by replacing the character with one or more octets of the UTF-8 representation of the character, with each octet in turn replaced by %HH, where HH represents the uppercase hexadecimal notation for the octet value and % is a literal character. Line breaks are represented as "CR LF" pairs (i.e., %0D%0A).  All such encodings are concatenated, maintaining document order. Example: This format consists of simple name-value pairs. Here is the instance data for the above example. Note that very little of the data is preserved. Authors desiring greater data integrity should select a different serialization format. The processing of the targetref attribute (and its default) is considered to have failed if the result is any of the following: an empty nodeset a readonly node, if replace="text" a non-element, if replace="instance" a node whose parent is readonly, if replace="instance" Examples: The address information is past to a postal code search service that returns a textual result, which is placed into the postalCode element. The single-node binding of the submission element refers to the XML data to be submitted.  In the case of a SOAP submission, the instance data includes the SOAP envelope and related SOAP tags. The form author may choose to store the data payload in one instance and copy the data to the submission instance containing the SOAP envelope as part of an xforms-submit event handler.  The form author is responsible for declaring the appropriate model item properties on both instances (e.g. the relevant declarations). The action MIME parameter has no effect unless the submission method is "post" because the GET method implies no SOAP processing by the receiving SOAP node. SOAP 1.1 does not support the HTTP GET operation. If method="get", then the SOAP response message exchange pattern is used.  The HTTP headers must contain the Accept parameter with a value conforming to the following properties: If the submission mediatype contains a charset MIME parameter, then it is appended to the application/soap+xml MIME type. Otherwise, a charset MIME parameter with same value as the encoding attribute (or its default) is appended to the application/soap+xml MIME type. No other MIME parameters from the mediatype are copied to the application/soap+xml MIME type The q MIME parameter must not be specified in the application/soap+xml MIME type so that the default quality of 1 is used. If method="post", then the SOAP request-response message exchange pattern is used.  For SOAP 1.2, the current submission behavior of using the mediatype attribute value as the value of the Content-type parameter in the HTTP headers is sufficient.  If the instance data being submitted has as its root element node a SOAP envelope in the SOAP 1.1 namespace (http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/), then:  if the action MIME parameter appears in the mediatype then a SOAPAction HTTP header is added and given a value equal to the content of the action MIME parameter XForms 1.1 does not support the SOAP email binding, so method="post" with a mailto: scheme results in an xforms-submit-error event before any submit processing message is dispatched. XForms 1.1 does not support the SOAP 1.1 binding to the HTTP Extension Framework. Example: The submission and the request and response instances correspond to the web service definition below: The XForms processor must handle client authorization and redirection. SOAP faults (400 and 500 level errors) are handled in the same manner as underlying HTTP errors, which is to say that an xforms-submit-error event is dispatched. On successful completion, the results are consumed according to the XForms submission process, culminating in an xforms-submit-done event.  The form author may capture this event and copy data from the target instance that receives the returned SOAP envelope to other instances that are designed to carry only data.

Pattern: &lt;insert context="parent of new element" origin="element to copy"/&gt; Operation: Prepend a new, empty person element into a list of people Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;insert context="parent of new element" nodeset="*" origin="element to copy"/&gt; Operation: Append a new, empty person element into a list of people Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;insert nodeset="exact element to duplicate"/&gt; The context attribute is not used because this pattern assumes the ability to indicate an exact element to duplicate, so nodeset is used. If the element does not exist, the operation will have no effect. Operation: Duplicate the selected element and place it as a following sibling Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;insert context="container element receiving attribute" origin="attribute to copy"/&gt; The nodeset attribute is not used because this pattern cannot indicate an exact attribute sibling of the attribute being inserted.  This is true not only because attribute order is not guaranteed but also because the attribute being inserted may already exist, in which case the existing attribute is replaced. The context attribute is used when it is necessary to indicate the parent of the node being inserted. Operation: Create or replace an attribute with a copy of a given attribute Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;delete nodeset="exact element to remove"/&gt; The context attribute is not used because this pattern assumes the ability to indicate an exact element to remove, so nodeset is used. If the element does not exist, the operation will have no effect. Operation: Remove item element in case it exists Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;delete nodeset="exact attribute to remove"/&gt; The context attribute is not used because this pattern assumes the ability to indicate an exact attribute to remove, so nodeset is used. If the attribute does not exist, the operation will have no effect. Operation: Remove rating attribute in case it exists Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;delete nodeset="nodeset to remove"/&gt; The context attribute is not used because this pattern assumes the ability to indicate a nodeset to remove, so nodeset is used. If the nodeset does not exist, the operation will have no effect. Operation: Remove track nodeset in case it exists Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;insert context="parent of new nodeset" nodeset="*" origin="nodeset to copy"/&gt; The context attribute is used so that this pattern will work whether or not the parent element is empty. Operation: Append a person nodeset into a list of people  Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;insert context="exact element receiving attribute list" origin="attribute list to copy"/&gt; Operation: Copy attribute list from one item to another Data Before Operation Data After Operation The context attribute is not used because this pattern assumes the ability to indicate an exact element to replace, so nodeset is used. If the element does not exist, both insert and delete operation will have no effect. Operation: Replace a person element by copying a new one and removing the old one Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;setvalue ref="exact attribute to replace" value="attribute to copy"/&gt; If the attribute does not exist, the operation will have no effect. Operation: Replace an attribute with the copy of a given attribute Data Before Operation Data After Operation Pattern: &lt;insert nodeset="root node of instance to replace" origin="element to copy"/&gt; The context attribute is not used because this pattern assumes the ability to indicate an instance root node to replace, so nodeset is used. Since an instance cannot be empty, nodeset will always be non-empty. Insert implements special handling for instance root nodes, thus a delete operation is not necessary. Operation: Replace instance root node with an empty shoppingcart element Data Before Operation Data After Operation Operation: Copy an existing element to a new parent and remove the original Data Before Operation Data After Operation If the attribute to be moved does not exist, both insert and delete operation will have no effect. Operation: Copy an existing attribute to a new element and remove the original Data Before Operation Data After Operation The context attribute is not used because it adheres to the first node rule and therefore would not allow to select a non-contiguous nodeset. The nodeset attribute is used instead to select a nodeset consisting of nodes with different names and different parents. The parent of the new node is the same as the parent of the insert location node selected by the combination of nodeset and at. Operation: Copy an existing element into a non-contiguous, heterogeneous nodeset at a specified position Data Before Operation Data After Operation XForms Processors are free (and encouraged) to skip or optimize any steps in this algorithm, as long as the end result is the same. The XForms recalculation algorithm considers model items and model item properties to be vertices in a directed graph. Edges between the vertices represent computational dependencies between vertices. Following is the default handling for a recalculate action. Action recalculate is defined in 10.10 The recalculate Element. A master dependency directed graph is created as detailed in C.1 Details on Creating the Master Dependency Directed Graph. To provide consistent behavior, implementations must reduce the number of vertices to be processed by computing a pertinent dependency subgraph consisting only of vertices and edges that are reachable from nodes that require recomputation. This is detailed in C.2 Details on Creating the Pertinent Dependency Subgraph. Note that on a first recomputation (such as on form load), the pertinent dependency subgraph will be the same as the master dependency directed graph. A topological sort is performed on the vertices of the pertinent dependency subgraph, resulting in an order of evaluation in which each vertex is evaluated only after those vertices on which it depends and before all vertices which depend on it. The topological sort algorithm is discussed at [Algorithms]. The recalculate process completes. The master dependency directed graph can be considered an array with one record for each vertex, each having the following fields: InstanceNode: a reference to the associated instance data nodetype: indicates the aspect of the instance node represented by the vertex (the text content or a model item property such as readOnly or required)depList: a list of vertices that refer to this vertexin-degree: the number of vertices on which this vertex dependsvisited: a flag used to ensure vertices are not added to a subgraph multiple timesindex: an association between vertices in the master dependency directed graph and a subgraph The depList for each vertex is assigned based on  the referenced XML nodes of  instance nodes, which are obtained by parsing the computed expression bound to the node (e.g., by calculate, relevant, readonly, or required). Any expression violating any Binding Expression Constraint causes an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event), terminating the recalculate process. Specifically, the depList for a vertex v is assigned to be the vertices other than v whose computational expressions reference v (described below). Vertex v is excluded from its own depList to allow self-references to occur without causing a circular reference exception. A computational expression appearing in a calculate attribute controls the text content (value) of one or more instance nodes. A vertex exists for each instance node to represent the expression in the context of the node. Likewise, computational expressions for model item properties such as readOnly and required are applied to one or more instance nodes, and vertices are created to represent such expressions in the context of each applicable node. The computational expression of each vertex must be examined to determine the XML nodes to which it refers. Any expression violating any Binding Expression Constraint causes an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event), terminating the recalculate process. A computation expression refers to a vertex v if a subexpression indicates the InstanceNode for v and v represents the instance node text content (its value). In this version of XForms, model item properties such as readOnly and required cannot be referenced in an expression. If all calculations must be performed, which is the case on form load, then the pertinent dependency subgraph is simply a duplicate of the master dependency directed graph. If the recalculation algorithm is invoked with a list of changed instance data nodes since the last recalculation, then the pertinent dependency subgraph is obtained by exploring the paths of edges and vertices in the computational dependency directed graph that are reachable from each vertex in the change list. The method of path exploration can be depth first search, a suitable version of which appears in the pseudo-code below. This algorithm creates a pertinent dependency subgraph S from a list of changed instance data nodes L&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. Variables such as v and w represent vertices in the master dependency directed graph. The same variables ending with S indicate vertices in the pertinent dependency subgraph S. Note that the number of vertices and dependency nodes in the pertinent dependency subgraph is not known beforehand, but a method such as array doubling (see [DDJ-ArrayDoubling]) can be used to ensure that building the subgraph is performed in time linear in the size of S. The following steps process vertices, resulting in a recalculated form: A vertex with inDegree of 0 is selected for evaluation and removed from the pertinent dependency subgraph. In the case where more than one vertex has inDegree zero, no particular ordering is specified. If the pertinent dependency subgraph contains vertices, but none have an inDegree of 0, then the calculation structure of the form has a loop, and an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event) must be thrown, terminating processing. If the vertex corresponds to a computed item, computed expressions are evaluated as follows: calculate: If the value of the model item changes, the corresponding instance data is updated and the dirty flag is set. relevant, readonly, required, constraint: If any or all of these computed properties change, the new settings are  placed into effect for associated form controls. For each vertex in the depList of the removed vertex, decrement the inDegree by 1. If no vertices remain in the pertinent dependency subgraph, then the calculation has successfully completed. Otherwise, repeat this sequence from step 1. For example, consider six vertices a, b, v, w, x, and y. Let a and b represent the text content of instance nodes that will be set by a binding from user input controls. Let v and w be vertices representing the calculated value and the validity property of a third instance node c. These vertices would result from a bind element B with calculate and constraint attributes and a nodeset attribute that indicates c. Suppose that the value of c is the product of a and b and that the value is only valid if it does not exceed 100. Likewise, suppose x and y are vertices representing the calculated value and the validity property of a fourth instance node d. Let the value of d be the sum of a and b, and let d be valid if the value does not exceed 20. The figure below depicts the dependency digraph for this example.    Vertices a and b have edges leading to v and x because these vertices represent the calculate expressions of c and d, which reference a and b to compute their product and sum, respectively. Similarly, v and x have directed edges to w and y, respectively, because w and y represent the constraint expressions of c and d, which reference the values of c and d to compare them with boundary values. If a and b are initially equal to 10, and the user changes a to 11, then it is necessary to first recalculate v (the value of c) then recalculate w (the validity property of the value of c). Likewise, x (the value of d) must be recalculated before recalculating y (the validity property of the value of d). In both cases, the validity of the value does not change to false until after the new product and sum are computed based on the change to a. However, there are no interdependencies between v and x, so the product and sum could be computed in either order. The pertinent subgraph excludes b and only vertex a has in-degree of zero. The vertex a is processed first. It is not a computed vertex, so no recalculation occurs on a, but its removal causes v and x to have in-degree zero. Vertex v is processed second. Its value changes to 121, and its removal drops the in-degree of vertex w to zero. Vertex x is processed next, changing value to 21. When x is removed, its neighbor y drops to in-degree zero. The fourth and fifth iterations of this process recalculate the validity of w and y, both of which change to false. P3P privacy policies may be associated with any forms transmitted over HTTP that have URIs associated with them. In the future, mechanisms may be specified for associating P3P policies with content transmitted over other protocols.  P3P allows for policies to be associated with an individual URI or a set of URIs. By associating a separate policy with each URI a site can declare a very precise policy that addresses exactly what data is collected with a particular HTTP request and how that data will be used. However, site management is substantially easier for many sites if they declare a single policy that covers many URIs, or even their entire Web presence.  The P3P specification specifies several methods for referencing a P3P policy reference file, which in turn associates P3P policies with URIs and cookies. XForms can be P3P enabled using any of the methods that are appropriate for the Web site in which they are embedded. Some special considerations regarding forms are addressed in the P3P Specification. [P3P 1.0]  Different P3P policies may be applied to the representation of a form embedded in a containing document to that which is associated with the data submitted via that form. If the form representation is served from a different server than the form is submitted to, it is likely that separate P3P policy reference files and policies will be needed. Typically the form representation causes only clickstream data (as defined in [P3P 1.0] section 5.6.4) to be transferred, while a form submission causes much more data to be transferred.  The attribute inputmode provides a hint to the user agent to select an appropriate input mode for the text input expected in an associated form control. The input mode may be a keyboard configuration, an input method editor (also called front end processor) or any other setting affecting input on the device(s) used.  Using inputmode, the author can give hints to the agent that make form input easier for the user. Authors should provide inputmode attributes wherever possible, making sure that the values used cover a wide range of devices. The value of the inputmode attribute is a white space separated list of tokens. Tokens are either sequences of alphabetic letters or absolute URIs. The later can be distinguished from the former by noting that absolute URIs contain a ':'. Tokens are case-insensitive. All the tokens consisting of alphabetic letters only are defined in this specification, in E.3 List of Tokens (or a successor of this specification). This specification does not define any URIs for use as tokens, but allows others to define such URIs for extensibility. This may become necessary for devices with input modes that cannot be covered by the tokens provided here. The URI should dereference to a human-readable description of the input mode associated with the use of the URI as a token. This description should describe the input mode indicated by this token, and whether and how this token modifies other tokens or is modified by other tokens. Upon entering an empty form control with an inputmode attribute, the user agent should select the input mode indicated by the inputmode attribute value. User agents should not use the inputmode attribute to set the input mode when entering a form control with text already present. To set the appropriate input mode when entering a form control that already contains text, user agents should rely on platform-specific conventions. User agents should make available all the input modes which are supported by the (operating) system/device(s) they run on/have access to, and which are installed for regular use by the user. This is typically only a small subset of the input modes that can be described with the tokens defined here. Additional guidelines for user agent implementation are found at [UAAG 1.0].  The following simple algorithm is used to define how user agents match the values of an inputmode attribute to the input modes they can provide. This algorithm does not have to be implemented directly; user agents just have to behave as if they used it. The algorithm is not designed to produce "obvious" or "desirable" results for every possible combination of tokens, but to produce correct behavior for frequent token combinations and predictable behavior in all cases. First, each of the input modes available is represented by one or more lists of tokens. An input mode may correspond to more than one list of tokens; as an example, on a system set up for a Greek user, both "greek upperCase" and "user upperCase" would correspond to the same input mode. No two lists will be the same. Second, the inputmode attribute is scanned from front to back. For each token t in the inputmode attribute, if in the remaining list of tokens representing available input modes there is any list of tokens that contains t, then all lists of tokens representing available input modes that do not contain t are removed. If there is no remaining list of tokens that contains t, then t is ignored. Third, if one or more lists of tokens are left, and they all correspond to the same input mode, then this input mode is chosen. If no list is left (meaning that there was none at the start) or if the remaining lists correspond to more than one input mode, then no input mode is chosen. Example: Assume the list of lists of tokens representing the available input modes is: {"cyrillic upperCase", "cyrillic lowerCase", "cyrillic", "latin", "user upperCase", "user lowerCase"}, then the following inputmode values select the following input modes: "cyrillic title" selects "cyrillic", "cyrillic lowerCase" selects "cyrillic lowerCase", "lowerCase cyrillic" selects "cyrillic lowerCase", "latin upperCase" selects "latin", but "upperCase latin" does select "cyrillic upperCase" or "user upperCase" if they correspond to the same input mode, and does not select any input mode if "cyrillic upperCase" and "user upperCase" do not correspond to the same input mode. Tokens defined in this specification are separated into two categories: Script tokens and modifiers. In inputmode attributes, script tokens should always be listed before modifiers.

Traditional PC keyboards do not need most modifier tokens (indeed, users on such devices would be quite confused if the software decided to change case on its own; CAPS lock for upperCase may be an exception). However, modifier tokens can be very helpful to set input modes for small devices. User agents may use information available in an XML Schema pattern facet to set the input mode. Note that a pattern facet is a hard restriction on the lexical value of an instance data node, and can specify different restrictions for different parts of the data item. Attribute inputmode is a soft hint about the kinds of characters that the user may most probably start to input into the form control. Attribute inputmode is provided in addition to pattern facets for the following reasons: The set of allowable characters specified in a pattern may be so wide that it is not possible to deduce a reasonable input mode setting. Nevertheless, there frequently is a kind of characters that will be input by the user with high probability. In such a case, inputmode allows to set the input mode for the user's convenience. In some cases, it would be possible to derive the input mode setting from the pattern because the set of characters allowed in the pattern closely corresponds to a set of characters covered by an inputmode attribute value. However, such a derivation would require a lot of data and calculations on the user agent. Small devices may leave the checking of patterns to the server, but will easily be able to switch to those input modes that they support. Being able to make data entry for the user easier is of particular importance on small devices. This is an example of  the user interface markup for  a form for user input in Japanese. . This informative section provides a broad outline of new and existing CSS features needed to style XForms content. A future Recommendation from the CSS Working Group will fully develop the specification of these features. A CSS pseudo-class is used to select elements for styling based on information that lies outside of the document tree or that cannot be expressed using the other selectors. This list is not exhaustive; other pseudo-classes may be defined. Pseudo-elements are abstractions about the document tree beyond those specified by the document language. Pseudo-elements do not appear in the DOM; they are used only for purposes of styling. This list is not exhaustive; other pseudo-elements may be defined.  This section presents complete XForms examples. These and additional examples are maintained at http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/2002/Examples. Schema file payschema.xsd: Initial instance file bookmarks.xml: The following example shows one possible way of integrating XForms with [SVG 1.1]. Note that the complete set of rules for integrating XForms and SVG are not fully specified at the time this specification was published. Future versions of the XForms, SVG, or other W3C specifications might define more complete rules for integrating XForms and SVG which might not be compatible with the example below. Note that the example below does not use SVG's switch and requiredExtensions features, which are commonly used in conjunction with foreignObject.

Boyer, IBM An introduction to XForms. The introduction outlines the design principles and includes a brief tutorial on XForms.  XForms reference manual. The bulk of the reference manual consists of the specification of XForms. This reference defines XForms and how XForms Processors must interpret the various components in order to claim conformance.  Appendixes contain an XML Schema description of XForms, references, examples, and other useful information.  Reference - linked to from above. Submitted data is strongly typed and can be checked using off-the-shelf tools. This speeds up form filling since it reduces the need for round trips to the server for validation. This obviates the need for custom server-side logic to marshal the submitted data to the application back-end. The received XML instance document can be directly validated and processed by the application back-end. This obviates duplication, and ensures that updating the validation rules as a result of a change in the underlying business logic does not require re-authoring validation constraints within the XForms application. This enables the XForms author to go beyond the basic set of constraints available from the back-end. Providing such additional constraints as part of the XForms Model enhances the overall usability of the resulting Web application. Using XML 1.0 for instance data ensures that the submitted data is internationalization ready. XForms separates content and presentation. User interface controls encapsulate all relevant metadata such as labels, thereby enhancing accessibility of the application when using different modalities. XForms user interface controls are generic and suited for device-independence. The high-level nature of the user interface controls, and the consequent intent-based authoring of the user interface makes it possible to re-target the user interaction to different devices. By defining XML-based declarative event handlers that cover common use cases, the majority of XForms documents can be statically analyzed, reducing the need for imperative scripts for event handlers. Foreign attributes are allowed on all XForms elements. The author-optional id attribute of type xsd:ID assigns an identity to the containing element. Binding expression interpreted as XPath. This attribute has no meaning when a bind attribute is present. Author-optional XForms Model selector. Specifies the ID of an XForms Model to be associated with this binding element. This attribute has no meaning for the current binding element when a bind attribute is present. Rules for determining the context XForms Model are located at 7.2 Evaluation Context. Author-optional  reference to a bind element. Binding expression interpreted as XPath. This attribute has no meaning when a bind attribute is present. Author-optional reference to a bind element. Author-optional space-separated list of XPath extension functions (represented by QNames) required by this XForms Model. Guidance on the use of this attribute is at 7.12 Extension Functions. Author-optional link to externally defined initial instance data. If the link traversal fails, it is treated as an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-link-exception Event). Author-optional link to externally defined initial instance data. If the link is traversed and the traversal fails, it is treated as an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-link-exception Event). Author-optional attribute to define an appearance hint. If absent, the user agent may freely choose any suitable rendering. This author-optional attribute is a non-negative integer in the range of 0-32767 used to define the navigation sequence. This gives the author control over the sequence in which form controls are traversed. The default navigation order is specified in the chapter 4 Processing Model. This author-optional attribute defines a shortcut for moving the input focus directly to a particular form control. The value of this is a single character which when pressed together with a platform specific modifier key (e.g., the alt key) results in the focus being set to this form control.The user agent must provide a means of identifying the accesskeys that can be used in a presentation. This may be accomplished in different ways by different implementations, for example through direct interaction with the application or via the user's guide. The accesskey requested by the author might not be made available by the player (for example it may not exist on the device used, or it may be used by the player itself). Therefore the user agent should make the specified key available, but may map the accesskey to a different interaction behavior. Author-optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Author-optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. Author-optional. This form control accepts an input mode hint. E Input Modes. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default value for this attribute is false. This form control does not use the UI Common attribute group, but nevertheless still contains an author-optional appearance attribute, as defined above. Author-optional. Space-separated list of suggested media types, used by the XForms Processor to determine the possible sources of data to upload.  Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is false. Author-optional attribute containing a  hint for the lexical starting bound for the range&mdash;a legal value for the underlying data. If provided, this value is used to further refine the constraints specified by the underlying model. Author-optional attribute containing a  hint for the ending bound for the range&mdash;a legal value for the underlying data. If provided, this value is used to further refine the constraints specified by the underlying model. Author-optional attribute containing a delta-value to use for incrementing or decrementing the value. Must be of a type capable of expressing the difference between two legal values of the underlying data. Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is false. Author-optional attribute determining whether free entry is allowed in the list. Default is "closed". Author-optional.  When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is true. Author-optional attribute determining whether free entry is allowed in the list. Default is "closed". Author-optional. When true, this form control will generate additional xforms-value-changed events. The default for this form control is true. Author-optional selection status for the case. The default value is "false". Author-optional 1-based initial value of the repeat index. The default value is 1. Author-optional hint to the XForms Processor as to how many elements from the collection to display.  Author-optional attribute defined in Section 10.17 Conditional Execution of XForms Actions. Author-optional attribute defined in Section 10.18 Iteration of XForms Actions. Required reference to a repeating element. Author-optional attribute for specifying the  name of the event to dispatch. Author-optional attribute for specifying the  reference to the event target.   Author-optional attribute containing a  boolean indicating if this event bubbles&mdash;as defined in [DOM2 Events]. The default value  is true for a custom event. For predefined events, this attribute has no effect. Author-optional attribute containing a  boolean indicating if this event is cancelable&mdash;as defined in [DOM2 Events]. The default value  is true for a custom event. For predefined events, this attribute has no effect. Author-optional attribute. Link to an external resource to load. Author-optional link behavior specifier. The allowed values are "replace" and "new". If this attribute is missing, a default value of "replace" is assumed. The document is loaded into a new presentation context, e.g., a new window. Form processing in the original window continues. The document is loaded into the current window. Form processing is interrupted, exactly as if the user had manually requested navigating to a new document. Author-optional selector binding expression enabling submission of a portion of the instance data. The selected node, and all descendants, are selected for submission. The default value is "/". Author-optional reference to a bind element. When present, the binding reference on this attribute is used in preference to any binding reference from the ref attribute. Author-optional boolean attribute that indicates whether or not the data validation checks of the submission are performed. The default value is "false" if the value of serialization is "none" and "true" otherwise. Author-optional boolean attribute that indicates whether or not the relevance pruning of the submission is performed. The default value is "false" if the value of serialization is "none" and "true" otherwise. Author-optional attribute specifying the version of XML to be serialized. The default is "1.0". Author-optional attribute specifying whether the serializer should add extra white space nodes for readability. The default is "false". Author-optional attribute specifying the mediatype for XML  serialization  of instance data. Authors should ensure that the type specified is compatible with the data being submitted, such as application/xml for posted XML data. The default is "application/xml".Note:This attribute does not affect serialization and cannot be used to override the serialization attribute.  It is only used to provide additional information about the submission data serialization when the serialization is application/xml.  For example, this attribute could be used to indicate that the content type of the XML serialization is text/xml. Author-optional attribute specifying an encoding for serialization. The default is "UTF-8". Author-optional attribute specifying whether to omit the XML declaration on the serialized instance data. The default value is "false". Author-optional attribute specifying whether to include a standalone declaration in the serialized XML.If the omit-xml-declaration attribute has the value true, then this attribute is ignored.  Otherwise, if this attribute is omitted, then the XML declaration does not include a standalone document declaration, and if this attribute is specified, then the XML declaration includes a standalone document declaration with the same value as this attribute. Author-optional attribute specifying element names to be serialized with CDATA sections. The default is empty string. Author-optional attribute providing control over namespace serialization. If absent, all namespace nodes present in the instance data are considered for serialization. If present, specifies list of namespace prefixes to consider for serialization, in addition to those visibly utilized. As in [Exc-C14N], the special value #default specifies the default namespace.

Different devices (such as voice browsers) can render the concept of "select one" as appropriate. Core form controls always have labels directly associated with them as child elements&mdash; this is a key feature designed to enhance accessibility. There is no need for an enclosing form element, as in HTML. (See 2.4 Multiple Forms per Document for details on how to author multiple forms per document) Markup for specifying form controls has been simplified in comparison with HTML forms. There is complete flexibility in the structure of the XML instance data, including the use of attributes. Notice that XML namespaces are used, and that a wrapper element of the author's choosing contains the instance data. Empty elements number and expiry serve as place-holders in the XML structure, and will be filled in with form data provided by the user. An initial value ("cc") for the form control is provided through the instance data, in this case an attribute method. In the submitted XML, this initial value will be replaced by the user input, if the user changes the form control displaying that data. Initialization Interaction Notification Error Conditions All XML Schemas are loaded. If an error occurs while attempting to access or process a remote document, processing halts with an exception (4.5.4 The xforms-link-exception Event). If applicable, P3P initialization occurs. [P3P 1.0] The single node  binding expression is evaluated, if it exists on the form control,  to ensure that it points to a node that exists. If this is not the case then the form control should behave in the same manner as if it had bound to a model item with the relevant model item property resolved to false. Otherwise, the user interface for the form control is created and initialized. For the first reference to an instance a default instance is created by following the rules described below.A root instanceData element is created. An instance data element node will be created using the binding expression from the user interface control as the name. If the name is not a valid QName, processing halts with an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event).  For the second and subsequent references to an instance which was automatically created the following processing is performed:If a matching instance data node is found, the user interface control will be connected to that element. If a matching instance data node is not found, an instance data node will be created using the binding expression from the user interface control as the name. If the name is not a valid QName, processing halts with an exception (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event).  For each node in the selected XPath node-set, any child bind elements are recursively processed as described in the three points of this list. the constraint model item property is true the value is non-empty if the required model item property is true All UI Expressions  are   reevaluated  (implementations may optimize this operation but must behave as if all UI Expressions are reevaluated). current values (for the appropriate form controls and related UI elements) validity the proper number of and content for repeat objects. Form controls that have a navindex specified and assign a positive value to it are navigated first.Outermost form controls are navigated in increasing order of the navindex value. Values need not be sequential nor must they begin with any particular value. Form controls that have identical navindex values are to be navigated in document order. Ancestor form controls (&lt;group&gt;, &lt;repeat&gt;, and &lt;switch&gt;) establish a local navigation sequence. All form controls within a local sequence are navigated, in increasing order of the navindex value, before any outside the local sequence are navigated. Form controls that have identical navindex values are navigated in document order.  Those form controls that do not specify navindex or supply a value of "0" are navigated next. These form controls are navigated in document order. Those form controls that are disabled, hidden, or not relevant are assigned a relative order in the overall sequence but do not participate as navigable controls.  The navigation sequence past the last form control (or before the first) is undefined. XForms Processors may cycle back to the first/last control, remove focus from the form, or other possibilities. When the form control is interactively changed, and has the incremental="true" setting, the event sequence described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change may be initiated at implementation dependent intervals. When the form control is interactively changed and does not have the incremental="true" setting, no events are required to be dispatched, and thus no order is defined. When the user activates the control and the value has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node, the event sequence consists of the events described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change followed by dispatching the DOMActivate event.  See 8.1.2 The input Element for an example. When focus changes from the form control and the value has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node,  the event sequence is as described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change. The implementation of an output dispatches xforms-output-error if it unable to process the output data (such as corrupt image data when the output mediatype indicates it is image data).  This event may occur each time the output is given new data (such as a change of data in the bound data node or a change of the bound data node). When a selection is interactively changed, and the select or select1 form control has the incremental="false" setting, the event sequence is described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change. When the user activates the control and the selection has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node, the event sequence consists of the events described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change followed by dispatching the DOMActivate event.  Note that this event sequence will have been preceded by the event sequence described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change at the moment the selection was changed. When focus changes from the form control and the selection has changed, then, after the new value is placed into the bound instance node,   the event sequence is as described at 4.6.7 Sequence: Value Change.  Note that this event sequence will have been preceded by the event sequence described at 4.6.6 Sequence: Selection Without Value Change at the moment the selection was changed. Activating the form control causes the event sequence defined at 4.6.8 Sequence: Activating a Trigger. Activating the form control causes the event sequence defined at 4.6.8 Sequence: Activating a Trigger, followed immediately by the event sequence defined at 4.6.9 Sequence: Submission. xforms-deselect (for each item deselected by the change, if any) xforms-select (for each item selected by the change, if any) xforms-recalculate xforms-revalidate [n] xforms-value-changed [n] xforms-valid or xforms-invalid [n] xforms-enabled or xforms-disabled [n] xforms-optional or xforms-required [n] xforms-readonly or xforms-readwrite [n] xforms-out-of-range or xforms-in-range Perform further deferred updates as necessary DOMActivate xforms-submit xforms-submit-serialize xforms-submit-done or xforms-submit-error Fixed properties are static values that the XForms Processor evaluates only once. Such properties consist of literals, and are not subject to XPath evaluation. Computed expressions are XPath expressions that provide a value to the XForms Processor. Such values are recalculated at certain times as specified by the XForms Processing Model (see 4 Processing Model). These expressions encode dynamic properties, often constraints, such as the dependency among various data items. Computed expressions are not restricted to examining the value of the instance data node to which they apply. XPath expressions provide the means to traverse the instance data; more complex computations may be encoded as call-outs to external scripts. Applicable XML schema definitions (including those associated an external or an inline schema, or by xsi:type) An XForms type constraint associated with the instance data node using XForms binding. If no type constraint is provided, the instance data node defaults to type="xsd:string" (default to string rule). No variable bindings are in place.   The available function library is defined below in 7.5 The XForms Function Library.   Any namespace declarations in scope for the attribute that defines the expression are applied to the expression.  The context node, position and size are determined according to rules described below. A binding element is "outermost" if the element has no ancestor binding elements. If an outermost binding element is contained by a model, then the context node for the outermost binding element is the top-level document element node of the default instance of the containing model element. Otherwise, the context node for outermost binding elements is the top-level document element node of the default instance in the default model.  For outermost binding elements, the context size and position are 1.  The context node, position and size for non-outermost binding elements is determined using  the binding expression attribute or in-scope evaluation context  of the  nearest ancestor binding element.  This is also referred to as "scoped resolution". For a non-outermost binding element:If the nearest ancestor binding element is not a bound element, then the in-scope evaluation context of the non-outermost binding element is equivalent to the in-scope evaluation context of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Single-Node binding, then the in-scope evaluation context of the non-outermost binding element has a context size and position of 1 and the context node is the one resulting from the Single-Node binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Node Set binding, then the XForms processor dynamically generates an occurrence of the non-outermost binding element for each of the nodes in the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element.  The dynamic in-scope evaluation context for each generated occurrence of the non-outermost binding element has a context size equal to the size of the nodeset identified by the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element, the context node is the node for which the occurrence of the non-outermost binding element was generated, and the position is equal to the position of the generator node in the nodeset identified by the Node Set Binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. If the nearest ancestor binding element expresses a Node Set binding, then the non-outermost binding element has its own in-scope evaluation context separately from those of its dynamically generated occurences described above.  The in-scope evaluation context has a context position of 1, and the context node and size are set by the first node and the size of the nodeset identified by the Node Set binding of the nearest ancestor binding element. Once the context node of the in-scope evaluation context has been determined according to the rules above, if the binding element expresses a model attribute that refers to a model other than the one containing the context node, then the context node of the in-scope evaluation context is changed to be the top-level document element node of the default instance of the referenced model, and the context position and size are changed to 1. All form controls, including container form controls, should have an inline layout by default (e.g. for a host language that supports CSS, the default styling should be display:inline).  By default, repeat items should have a block layout (e.g. a default styling of display:block for host languages that support CSS). If a form control violates its data binding restriction, an xforms-binding-exception must occur.Note:Form controls that read or write simpleContent produce this exception whenever and as soon as they are bound to an element node that has an element child node. Form controls that write simpleContent to instance data must do so exactly as defined by the XForms Action setvalue (10.2 The setvalue Element).Note:If a form control binds to an element node, then regardless of how many child nodes the element has, the result of the form control writing to the bound element node is that it has either a single non-empty text node child, or no children if the simpleContent written is the empty string (which is in accord with the data model of [XPath 1.0]). Attribute nodes: returns the string-value of the node. Text nodes: returns the string-value of the node. Namespace, processing instruction, and comment nodes: behavior is undefined (implementation-dependent). the XPath root node: an xforms-binding-exception occurs. the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to empty nodeset, the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to a non-relevant instance node, the form control is contained by a non-relevant switch or group (which includes a non-relevant repeat item), or the form control is contained by a non-selected case element of a switch. Except as noted, relevant form controls must distinguish rendering between being bound to a required node versus a non-required node. Exceptions are form controls that do not directly render the string value of the bound node (including trigger and the container form controls).  Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. Relevant  form controls must distinguish rendering between valid and invalid states. Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. Relevant  form controls must indicate when the bound instance data contains a value or content that  the form control is not capable of rendering. Control of this behavior should be made available to stylesheets. If a form control binds to a readonly node, then the form control must not allow the user to modify the node value.  The relevant form control that is bound to a readonly node  should render in a way which indicates that entering or changing the value is not allowed. Control of the render behavior should be made available to stylesheets. If the instance node either is of type or is derived from type xsd:base64Binary, then the data is base-64 decoded. If the instance node either is of type or is derived from type xsd:hexBinary, then the data is hex-binary decoded. If the instance node either is of type or is derived from type xsd:anyURI, then the data is treated as a URI and dereferenced. If the instance node is of any other type, then the data is used without modification. Data to be decoded does not conform to the format of xsd:base64Binary or xsd:hexBinary An error dereferencing the URI in a node of or derived from type xsd:anyURI A data format error (e.g. invalid or unsupported image format) An unrecognized media type identifier string When bound to an instance data node of type xsd:base64binary, xsd:hexBinary, or a type derived by restriction thereof, on activation upload places the binary content in the content of the node with the indicated encoding. When bound to an instance data node of type xsd:anyURI (or a type derived by restriction thereof), on activation upload places a URI in the content of the node.For security reasons, the XForms Processor must not dereference the URI bound to this form control without explicit user permission.Note:Implementors note that upload must associate the binary content, mediatype, and filename with that URI for 11.9.6 Serialization as multipart/related and 11.9.7 Serialization as multipart/form-data serialization.  Implementations with a file system should support file upload&mdash;selecting a specific file. The types of files presented by default should reflect the mediatype specified by attribute mediatype, for example defaulting to only audio file types in the file dialog when the mediatype is "audio/*".  Implementations with specific pen/digitizer hardware should (and implementations with other pointing devices may) support scribble&mdash;allowing in-place creation of pen-based data.  Implementations with specific audio recording capabilities should support record audio&mdash;in-place recording of an audio clip.  Implementations with a digital camera, scanner interface or screen capture should support acquire image&mdash;in-place upload of images from an attached device.  Implementations with video recording capability should provide a record video option.  Implementations with 3d capabilities should provide a 3d interface option. Implementations may provide proprietary implementations (for example, a mediatype of text/rtf could invoke an edit window with a proprietary word processing application) Implementations are encouraged to support other input devices not mentioned here. Implementations which cannot support upload for the given mediatype must make this apparent to the user. On activation, if child element filename is present and a filename is available, upload places the filename of the data to upload in the instance at the node indicated by the binding attributes on child element filename. On activation, if child element mediatype is present and a mediatype is available, upload places the mediatype of the data to upload in the instance at the node indicated by the binding attributes on child element mediatype.  Factoring all human readable messages to a separate resource XML file. Using URIs into this XML resource bundle within individual label elements Finally, an XForms implementation could use content negotiation to obtain the appropriate XML resource bundle, e.g., based on the accept-language headers from the client, to serve up the user interface with messages localized to the client's locale. the value of a node indicated by a single node binding expression, if specified the result of evaluating an XPath expression appearing in attribute value, if specified the inline content of the value element (when neither the single node binding nor the value attribute are expressed). the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to empty nodeset, the Single Node Binding is expressed and resolves to a non-relevant instance node, the group is contained by a non-relevant switch or group (which includes a non-relevant repeat object), or the group is contained by a non-selected case element of a switch. The Node Set Binding is evaluated to locate the  repeat collection  to be operated on by this repeat.  The index for this repeating structure is initialized to the value of startindex. If the initial startindex is less than 1 it defaults to 1. If the index is greater than the initial node-set then it defaults to the size of the node-set.  User interface as specified by the repeat is generated for the requisite number of members of the collection as specified by attributes on element repeat.  An insert action can add one or more nodes that match the repeat nodeset; The new instance data subtree created by a submission instance replacement may contain nodes that match the repeat nodeset; A setvalue action or a calculate may change a value that causes one or more nodes to match the repeat nodeset. A delete action can remove nodes that matched the repeat nodeset; The new instance data subtree created by a submission instance replacement may replace nodes that matched the repeat nodeset; A setvalue action or a calculate may change a value that causes one or more nodes to stop matching the repeat nodeset. The target node, selected by the binding attributes on the list form control, must be an element node, otherwise an exception results (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). The element node associated with the item, selected by the binding attributes on copy, is deep copied as a child of the target node  by using  an insert action  (10.3 The insert Element). A full computational dependency rebuild is done, followed by recalculate, revalidate, and refresh. The target node, selected by the binding attributes on the list form control, must be an element node, otherwise an exception results (4.5.1 The xforms-binding-exception Event). The child element node associated with the item, selected by the binding attributes on copy, is deleted  by using  a delete action  (10.4 The delete Element). A full computational dependency rebuild, followed by recalculate, revalidate, and refresh. Attribute nodes: The string-value of the attribute is replaced with a string corresponding to the new value. Text nodes: The text node is replaced with a new one corresponding to the new value, or the text node is eliminated if the new value is the empty string. Namespace, processing instruction, and comment nodes: behavior is undefined (implementation-dependent). the XPath root node: an xforms-binding-exception occurs. The XForms action system's deferred update flags for rebuild, recalculate, revalidate and refresh are set. Dispatches an xforms-deselect event to the currently selected case  in the switch containing the identified case. Adjusts the selected states (not the attribute values) on the affected cases to reflect the new state of the switch containing the identified case. Dispatches an xform-select event to the case just selected. Predefined XForms events (i.e., xforms-event-name), in which case the bubbles and cancelable attributes are ignored and the standard semantics as defined in 4 Processing Model apply. An event created by the XForms author with no predefined XForms semantics and as such not handled by default by the XForms Processor. The submission method is determined. The submission resource is determined. If the resource is not specified, then submission processing stops after dispatching even xforms-submit-error with context information containing an error-type of resource-error. Behaviors of other possible values for attribute replace are not defined in this specification. document order of header elements node order of nodes in nodeset attribute document order of value elements the submission resource the submission method the header elements The submit URI is examined. If it does not already contain a ? (question mark) character, one is appended. If it does already contain a question mark character and the serialized form data is non-empty, then a separator character from the attribute separator is appended. The serialized form data, if any,  is appended to the URI. An XML document is produced following the rules of the XML output method defined in [XSLT 1.0] section 16 and 16.1, using the values supplied as attributes of the submission element.Handling of namespace nodes: The default behavior is that every namespace node is serialized according to the rules of the XML output method, so that at least one namespace declaration appears in the serialized XML for each in-scope namespace. Additional inherited namespaces are declared on the root element of the serialized XML. If, however, attribute includenamespaceprefixes on element submission is present, then all namespace declarations not visibly utilized in the instance data (as defined in [Exc-C14N]) and the default namespace if it is empty are excluded from the root element serialization, unless the corresponding namespace prefix is listed in the includenamespaceprefixes attribute. The special value #default represents the default namespace.  Mediatype: By default, the mediatype of the serialized XML instance is application/xml, but can be changed to a compatible type using element submission attribute mediatype. Authors should ensure that the type specified is compatible with application/xml. multipart/related message header requirements:Must contain a type parameter of the mediatype of the serialized XML instance. Must contain a start parameter referring to the Content-ID first body part (root). First body part (root) requirements:Must have Content-Type parameter of the type specified by the submission mediatype attribute. Content is serialized by the rules at 11.9.5 Serialization as application/xml. Subsequent part requirements:One part for each node with a datatype of xsd:anyURI populated by upload with:A Content-Type header that represents the type of the attachment if known, otherwise application/octet-stream. A Content-Transfer-Encoding header. A Content-ID header whose value matches the URI in the associated instance data node. The binary content associated with the URI, serialized according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding heading. Each element node is visited in document order, except non-relevant elements are skipped if the relevant setting of the submission is true. Each visited element that has no child element nodes (i.e., each leaf element node) is selected for inclusion, including those that have no value (no text node). Element nodes selected for inclusion are  encoded as Content-Disposition: form-data MIME parts as defined in [RFC 2388], with the name parameter being the element local name. Element nodes of any datatype populated by upload also have a Content-Disposition filename parameter, if the filename is available.  Element nodes of any datatype not populated by upload are serialized as the string value of the element (the concatenation of all text node children, or empty string if the element has no text node children). The Content-Type must be text/plain except for xsd:anyURI, xsd:base64Binary, xsd:hexBinary, and derived types, in which case the header represents the media type of the attachment if known, otherwise application/octet-stream. If a character set is applicable, the Content-Type may have a charset parameter. Element nodes selected for inclusion are encoded as EltName=value, where = is a literal character, EltName represents the element local name, and value represents the string value of the element (the concatenation of all text node children, or empty string if the element has no text node children). The separator character {sep} from the separator attribute on submission is used between pairs of encoded name/value pairs, e.g. EltName1=value1{sep}EltName2=value2{sep}EltName3=value3. Note that contextual path information is not preserved, nor are namespaces or namespace prefixes. As a result, different elements might serialize to the same name.The encoding of EltName and value are as follows: space characters are replaced by +, and then non-ASCII and reserved characters (as defined by [RFC 2396] as amended by subsequent documents in the IETF track) are escaped by replacing the character with one or more octets of the UTF-8 representation of the character, with each octet in turn replaced by %HH, where HH represents the uppercase hexadecimal notation for the octet value and % is a literal character. Line breaks are represented as "CR LF" pairs (i.e., %0D%0A).  All such encodings are concatenated, maintaining document order. an empty nodeset a readonly node, if replace="text" a non-element, if replace="instance" a node whose parent is readonly, if replace="instance" If the submission mediatype contains a charset MIME parameter, then it is appended to the application/soap+xml MIME type. Otherwise, a charset MIME parameter with same value as the encoding attribute (or its default) is appended to the application/soap+xml MIME type. No other MIME parameters from the mediatype are copied to the application/soap+xml MIME type The q MIME parameter must not be specified in the application/soap+xml MIME type so that the default quality of 1 is used. if the action MIME parameter appears in the mediatype then a SOAPAction HTTP header is added and given a value equal to the content of the action MIME parameter [XML 1.0] [XML Names] [XPath 1.0] [XML Events] [XML Schema part 2] [XML 1.0] [XML Names] [XPath 1.0] [XML Events] (not all aspects are required) [XML Schema part 2] The processor may support the Extension module.  A master dependency directed graph is created as detailed in C.1 Details on Creating the Master Dependency Directed Graph. To provide consistent behavior, implementations must reduce the number of vertices to be processed by computing a pertinent dependency subgraph consisting only of vertices and edges that are reachable from nodes that require recomputation. This is detailed in C.2 Details on Creating the Pertinent Dependency Subgraph. Note that on a first recomputation (such as on form load), the pertinent dependency subgraph will be the same as the master dependency directed graph. A topological sort is performed on the vertices of the pertinent dependency subgraph, resulting in an order of evaluation in which each vertex is evaluated only after those vertices on which it depends and before all vertices which depend on it. The topological sort algorithm is discussed at [Algorithms]. The recalculate process completes. A vertex with inDegree of 0 is selected for evaluation and removed from the pertinent dependency subgraph. In the case where more than one vertex has inDegree zero, no particular ordering is specified. If the pertinent dependency subgraph contains vertices, but none have an inDegree of 0, then the calculation structure of the form has a loop, and an exception (4.5.2 The xforms-compute-exception Event) must be thrown, terminating processing. If the vertex corresponds to a computed item, computed expressions are evaluated as follows:calculate: If the value of the model item changes, the corresponding instance data is updated and the dirty flag is set. relevant, readonly, required, constraint: If any or all of these computed properties change, the new settings are  placed into effect for associated form controls. For each vertex in the depList of the removed vertex, decrement the inDegree by 1. If no vertices remain in the pertinent dependency subgraph, then the calculation has successfully completed. Otherwise, repeat this sequence from step 1.

Nevertheless, there frequently is a kind of characters that will be input by the user with high probability. In such a case, inputmode allows to set the input mode for the user's convenience. In some cases, it would be possible to derive the input mode setting from the pattern because the set of characters allowed in the pattern closely corresponds to a set of characters covered by an inputmode attribute value. However, such a derivation would require a lot of data and calculations on the user agent. Small devices may leave the checking of patterns to the server, but will easily be able to switch to those input modes that they support. Being able to make data entry for the user easier is of particular importance on small devices. John M.

Some modules define lists of explicit element names called content sets. When a content set is included in a content model, its name will be listed. Zero or one instances of expr are permitted. One or more instances of expr are required. Zero or more instances of expr are permitted. Expression a is required, followed by expression b. Either expression a or expression b is required. Expression a is permitted, omitting elements in expression b. In some instances, a module adds attributes to an element. In these instances, the element name is followed by an ampersand (&amp;). When an element requires the definition of an attribute, that attribute name is followed by an asterisk (*). When a module defines the type of an attribute value, it does so by listing the type in parentheses after the attribute name. Refers to the first document in a collection of documents. This link type tells search engines which document is considered by the author to be the starting point of the collection. Refers to the next document in a linear sequence of documents. User agents may choose to pre-load the "next" document, to reduce the perceived load time. Refers to the previous document in an ordered series of documents.

Contents Contents This section is normative. Except when overridden in this document, the semantics of these elements and attributes are defined in [HTML4]. The following basic attribute sets are used on many elements. In each case where they are used, their use is identified via their collection name rather than enumerating the list. Note that the Events collection is only defined when the Intrinsic Events Module is selected. Otherwise, the Events collection is empty. Also note that the Style collection is only defined when the Style Attribute Module is selected. Otherwise, the Style collection is empty. Finally, note that the I18N collection only contains the xml:lang attribute unless the Bi-directional Text Module module is selected.

Except when overridden in this document, the semantics of these elements and attributes are defined in [HTML4]. The following basic attribute sets are used on many elements. In each case where they are used, their use is identified via their collection name rather than enumerating the list. Note that the Events collection is only defined when the Intrinsic Events Module is selected. Otherwise, the Events collection is empty. Also note that the Style collection is only defined when the Style Attribute Module is selected. Otherwise, the Style collection is empty. The core modules are modules that are required to be present in any XHTML Family Conforming Document Type. This module is the basic structural definition for XHTML content. The html element acts as the root element for all XHTML Family Document Types. Implementation: DTD This module defines all of the basic text container elements, attributes, and their content model: The minimal content model for this module defines some content sets: Implementation: DTD The Hypertext Module provides the element that is used to define hypertext links to other resources. This module supports the following element and attributes: This module adds the a element to the Inline content set of the Text Module. Implementation: DTD As its name suggests, the List Module provides list-oriented elements.

Contents Contents This section is normative. Except when overridden in this document, the semantics of these elements and attributes are defined in [HTML4]. The following basic attribute sets are used on many elements. In each case where they are used, their use is identified via their collection name rather than enumerating the list. Note that the Events collection is only defined when the Intrinsic Events Module is selected. Otherwise, the Events collection is empty. Also note that the Style collection is only defined when the Style Attribute Module is selected. Otherwise, the Style collection is empty. Finally, note that the I18N collection only contains the xml:lang attribute unless the Bi-directional Text Module module is selected. The core modules are modules that are required to be present in any XHTML Family Conforming Document Type. This module is the basic structural definition for XHTML content. The html element acts as the root element for all XHTML Family Document Types.

Contents Contents This section is normative. Except when overridden in this document, the semantics of these elements and attributes are defined in [HTML4]. The following basic attribute sets are used on many elements. In each case where they are used, their use is identified via their collection name rather than enumerating the list. Note that the Events collection is only defined when the Intrinsic Events Module is selected. Otherwise, the Events collection is empty. Also note that the Style collection is only defined when the Style Attribute Module is selected. Otherwise, the Style collection is empty. Finally, note that the I18N collection only contains the xml:lang attribute unless the Bi-directional Text Module module is selected. The core modules are modules that are required to be present in any XHTML Family Conforming Document Type. This module is the basic structural definition for XHTML content. The html element acts as the root element for all XHTML Family Document Types. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This module defines all of the basic text container elements, attributes, and their content model: The minimal content model for this module defines some content sets: Implementations: DTD, XML Schema The Hypertext Module provides the element that is used to define hypertext links to other resources. This module supports the following element and attributes: This module adds the a element to the Inline content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema As its name suggests, the List Module provides list-oriented elements. Specifically, the List Module supports the following elements and attributes: This module also defines the content set List with the minimal content model (dl | ol | ul)+ and adds this set to the Flow content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This module is deprecated. Similar functionality can be found in the Object Module. The Applet Module provides elements for referencing external applications. Specifically, the Applet Module supports the following elements and attributes: When the Applet Module is used, it adds the applet element to the Inline content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This section defines a variety of additional textual markup modules.

Contents Contents This section is normative. Except when overridden in this document, the semantics of these elements and attributes are defined in [HTML4]. The following basic attribute sets are used on many elements. In each case where they are used, their use is identified via their collection name rather than enumerating the list. Note that the Events collection is only defined when the Intrinsic Events Module is selected. Otherwise, the Events collection is empty. Also note that the Style collection is only defined when the Style Attribute Module is selected. Otherwise, the Style collection is empty. Finally, note that the I18N collection only contains the xml:lang attribute unless the Bi-directional Text Module module is selected. The core modules are modules that are required to be present in any XHTML Family Conforming Document Type. This module is the basic structural definition for XHTML content. The html element acts as the root element for all XHTML Family Document Types. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This module defines all of the basic text container elements, attributes, and their content model: The minimal content model for this module defines some content sets: Implementations: DTD, XML Schema The Hypertext Module provides the element that is used to define hypertext links to other resources. This module supports the following element and attributes: This module adds the a element to the Inline content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema As its name suggests, the List Module provides list-oriented elements. Specifically, the List Module supports the following elements and attributes: This module also defines the content set List with the minimal content model (dl | ol | ul)+ and adds this set to the Flow content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This module is deprecated. Similar functionality can be found in the Object Module. The Applet Module provides elements for referencing external applications. Specifically, the Applet Module supports the following elements and attributes: When the Applet Module is used, it adds the applet element to the Inline content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This section defines a variety of additional textual markup modules.

Contents Contents This section is normative. Except when overridden in this document, the semantics of these elements and attributes are defined in [HTML4]. The following basic attribute sets are used on many elements. In each case where they are used, their use is identified via their collection name rather than enumerating the list. Note that the Events collection is only defined when the Intrinsic Events Module is selected. Otherwise, the Events collection is empty. Also note that the Style collection is only defined when the Style Attribute Module is selected. Otherwise, the Style collection is empty. Finally, note that the I18N collection only contains the xml:lang attribute unless the Bi-directional Text Module module is selected. The core modules are modules that are required to be present in any XHTML Family Conforming Document Type. This module is the basic structural definition for XHTML content. The html element acts as the root element for all XHTML Family Document Types. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This module defines all of the basic text container elements, attributes, and their content model: The minimal content model for this module defines some content sets: Implementations: DTD, XML Schema The Hypertext Module provides the element that is used to define hypertext links to other resources. This module supports the following element and attributes: This module adds the a element to the Inline content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema As its name suggests, the List Module provides list-oriented elements. Specifically, the List Module supports the following elements and attributes: This module also defines the content set List with the minimal content model (dl | ol | ul)+ and adds this set to the Flow content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This module is deprecated. Similar functionality can be found in the Object Module. The Applet Module provides elements for referencing external applications. Specifically, the Applet Module supports the following elements and attributes: When the Applet Module is used, it adds the applet element to the Inline content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This section defines a variety of additional textual markup modules.

Contents Contents This section is normative. Except when overridden in this document, the semantics of these elements and attributes are defined in [HTML4]. The following basic attribute sets are used on many elements. In each case where they are used, their use is identified via their collection name rather than enumerating the list. Note that the Events collection is only defined when the Intrinsic Events Module is selected. Otherwise, the Events collection is empty. Also note that the Style collection is only defined when the Style Attribute Module is selected. Otherwise, the Style collection is empty. Finally, note that the I18N collection only contains the xml:lang attribute unless the Bi-directional Text Module module is selected. The core modules are modules that are required to be present in any XHTML Family Conforming Document Type. This module is the basic structural definition for XHTML content. The html element acts as the root element for all XHTML Family Document Types. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This module defines all of the basic text container elements, attributes, and their content model: The minimal content model for this module defines some content sets: Implementations: DTD, XML Schema The Hypertext Module provides the element that is used to define hypertext links to other resources. This module supports the following element and attributes: This module adds the a element to the Inline content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema As its name suggests, the List Module provides list-oriented elements. Specifically, the List Module supports the following elements and attributes: This module also defines the content set List with the minimal content model (dl | ol | ul)+ and adds this set to the Flow content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This module is deprecated. Similar functionality can be found in the Object Module. The Applet Module provides elements for referencing external applications. Specifically, the Applet Module supports the following elements and attributes: When the Applet Module is used, it adds the applet element to the Inline content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This section defines a variety of additional textual markup modules. This module defines elements, attributes, and a minimal content model for simple presentation-related markup: Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This module defines elements and attributes for use in editing-related markup: When this module is used, the del and ins elements are added to the Inline content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema The Bi-directional Text module defines an element that can be used to declare the bi-directional rules for the element's content. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This module defines two content sets: When this module is used, it adds the Form content set to the Block content set and it adds the Formctrl content set to the Inline content set as these are defined in the Text Module. The Basic Forms Module is a subset of the Forms Module. These modules may not be used together in a single document type. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema The Forms Module provides all of the forms features found in HTML 4.0. Specifically, the Forms Module supports: This module defines two content sets: When this module is used, it adds the Form content set to the Block content set and it adds the Formctrl content set to the Inline content set as these are defined in the Text Module. The Forms Module is a superset of the Basic Forms Module. These modules may not be used together in a single document type. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema The Basic Tables Module provides table-related elements, but only in a limited form.

Contents Contents This section is normative. Except when overridden in this document, the semantics of these elements and attributes are defined in [HTML4]. The following basic attribute sets are used on many elements. In each case where they are used, their use is identified via their collection name rather than enumerating the list. Note that the Events collection is only defined when the Intrinsic Events Module is selected. Otherwise, the Events collection is empty. Also note that the Style collection is only defined when the Style Attribute Module is selected. Otherwise, the Style collection is empty. Finally, note that the I18N collection only contains the xml:lang attribute unless the Bi-directional Text Module module is selected. The core modules are modules that are required to be present in any XHTML Family Conforming Document Type. This module is the basic structural definition for XHTML content. The html element acts as the root element for all XHTML Family Document Types. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This module defines all of the basic text container elements, attributes, and their content model: The minimal content model for this module defines some content sets: Implementations: DTD, XML Schema The Hypertext Module provides the element that is used to define hypertext links to other resources. This module supports the following element and attributes: This module adds the a element to the Inline content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema As its name suggests, the List Module provides list-oriented elements. Specifically, the List Module supports the following elements and attributes: This module also defines the content set List with the minimal content model (dl | ol | ul)+ and adds this set to the Flow content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This module is deprecated. Similar functionality can be found in the Object Module. The Applet Module provides elements for referencing external applications. Specifically, the Applet Module supports the following elements and attributes: When the Applet Module is used, it adds the applet element to the Inline content set of the Text Module. Implementations: DTD, XML Schema This section defines a variety of additional textual markup modules.

Many simple Web clients cannot display fonts other than monospace. Bi-directional text, bold faced font, and other text extension elements are not supported. It is recommended that style sheets be used to create a presentation that is appropriate for the device. Frames are not supported. Frames depend on a screen interface and may not be applicable to some small appliances like phones, pagers, and watches. This section is normative. This section is normative. XHTML Basic consists of the following XHTML modules: Note: (*) = This module is a required XHTML Host Language module. Finally, XHTML Basic adds the value attribute to the li element of the XHTML List Module. This section is normative. This section was originally a component of XForms 1.0, and was written by Martin Duerst. The inputmode Attribute Module defines the inputmode attribute. The following table shows additional attributes for elements defined elsewhere when the inputmode module is selected. Note: Additional guidelines for user agent implementation are found at [UAAG 1.0]. This is an example of a form for Japanese address input. Version 1.1 of this specification was produced by the W3C XHTML2 Working Group. At the time of publication, the members were: At publication of the second edition, the membership was: This appendix is normative. Finally, we define the new inputmode attribute module. This appendix is normative. XHTML Family implementations using XML Schema are required to provide their own schema module that imports the required modules from XHTML Modularization. 5.3.1 Script Tokens 5.3.2 Modifier Tokens This version: Latest version: Previous version: Diff-marked from previous version: Previous recommendation: Diff-marked from previous version: Editor: Version 1.1 Editors: Version 1.0 Editors: Structure Module* Text Module* Hypertext Module* List Module* Forms Module Basic Tables Module Image Module Object Module Presentation module Metainformation Module Link Module Base Module Intrinsic Events module Scripting module Stylesheet module Style Attribute Module Deprecated Target Module inputmode = CDATA [RFC2854] [RFC3236] [XFORMS] [XHTMLMIME] http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xhtml-basic-20101123 http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic xhtml-basic-diff.html xhtml-basic-rec-diff.html Mark Baker, Sun Microsystems Masayasu Ishikawa, (until March 2007 while at W3C) Shinichi Matsui, Panasonic Peter Stark, Ericsson Ted Wugofski, Openwave Systems Toshihiko Yamakami, ACCESS Co., Ltd. body, head, html, title abbr, acronym, address, blockquote, br, cite, code, dfn, div, em, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, kbd, p, pre, q, samp, span, strong, var a dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li button, fieldset, form, input, label, legend, select, optgroup, option, textarea caption, table, td, th, tr img object, param b, big, hr, i, small, sub, sup, tt meta link base Events attributes script and noscript elements style element style attribute This attribute specifies style information for the current element.

All sections of this document are normative unless noted as informative. This section is informative. Events are not applicable to static, printed versions of a document. Therefore, the Intrinsic Events module is not part of XHTML-Print. Frames are not supported. Frames depend on a screen interface and therefore are not applicable to printers. XHTML-Print consists of the following XHTML modules: Each attribute in the following sections is annotated with one of the following keywords indicating support options for a conforming printer: Note that the title attribute of the Core collection is not applicable to the printed page since there is no place to display such supplementary information. A printer MAY ignore the content of the title element since it is not part of the document's body. The src attribute of the input element is not supported since the image type is not part of basic forms. This module adds the style attribute to the Common attribute collection (section 3.1). within the JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) and EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) files. [Informative] In traditional Web-based applications of XHTML, image data is contained in a separate file on a Web server that the user agent retrieves. This section is informative.

All sections of this document are normative unless noted as informative. Please report errors in this document to www-html-editor@w3.org (archive). All sections of this document are normative unless noted as informative. This section is informative. Events are not applicable to static, printed versions of a document. Therefore, the Intrinsic Events module is not part of XHTML-Print. Frames are not supported. Frames depend on a screen interface and therefore are not applicable to printers. XHTML-Print consists of the following XHTML modules: Each attribute in the following sections is annotated with one of the following keywords indicating support options for a conforming printer: Note that the title attribute of the Core collection is not applicable to the printed page since there is no place to display such supplementary information. A printer MAY ignore the content of the title element since it is not part of the document's body. The src attribute of the input element is not supported since the image type is not part of basic forms. This module adds the style attribute to the Common attribute collection (section 3.1). within the JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) and EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) files. [Informative] In traditional Web-based applications of XHTML, image data is contained in a separate file on a Web server that the user agent retrieves. This section is informative. The following discussion illustrates the activity involved when interacting with and printing forms. Please refer to Sequence Diagram 1 Steps: Detailed discussion of Steps: Here is an example presentation of the above form as the user would see it: This section is informative.  This specification was prepared by the W3C HTML Working Group. The participants at the time of publication were: At publication of the second edition, the membership was: This section describes behaviors of JPEG decoders for XHTML-Print conformant implementations. This section describes a RECOMMENDED color management approach for XHTML-Print printers. Sample values in a grayscale (single-component) JPEG image MAY be converted to the sRGB color space by setting or by other suitable algorithm specific to the XHTML-Print device.

The DTD subset MUST NOT be used to override any parameter entities in the DTD. A conforming printer SHALL support all XHTML Modules listed in The XHTML-Print Document Type. A conforming printer SHALL print a static version of a form using default and selected values as specified in the form. The attribute applies to a user interface which is not represented on a printed page. For example, the accesskey attribute is irrelevant. The attribute applies to form submission which is not performed by the printer, the method attribute of the form element for example. The attribute, such as title, describes data which is not represented on a printed page The attribute applies to objects other than JPEG images, such as Java applets. The attribute does not apply since links specified by the anchor element are not followed. Embedded thumbnails Rotation Progressive rendering The User enters a URL into the Browser The Browser fetches the form from the Server and displays it The User enters data into the form The User asks the Browser to print the form The Browser composes a page with the form and the user data The Browser sends the newly composed form to the printer The User selects the Submit button on the form The Browser sends the user data to the Server The user then clicks on the browser's print button (step 4 of Sequence Diagram 1), to print the form as it currently appears. The browser sends (step 6 of Sequence Diagram 1) the document created in step 5 to the printer.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats.

All sections of this document are normative unless noted as informative. This section is informative. Events are not applicable to static, printed versions of a document. Therefore, the Intrinsic Events module is not part of XHTML-Print. Frames are not supported. Frames depend on a screen interface and therefore are not applicable to printers. XHTML-Print consists of the following XHTML modules: Each attribute in the following sections is annotated with one of the following keywords indicating support options for a conforming printer: Note that the title attribute of the Core collection is not applicable to the printed page since there is no place to display such supplementary information. A printer MAY ignore the content of the title element since it is not part of the document's body. The src attribute of the input element is not supported since the image type is not part of basic forms. This module adds the style attribute to the Common attribute collection (section 3.1). within the JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) and EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) files. [Informative] In traditional Web-based applications of XHTML, image data is contained in a separate file on a Web server that the user agent retrieves. This section is informative.

All sections of this document are normative unless noted as informative. This section is informative. Events are not applicable to static, printed versions of a document. Therefore, the Intrinsic Events module is not part of XHTML-Print. Frames are not supported. Frames depend on a screen interface and therefore are not applicable to printers. XHTML-Print consists of the following XHTML modules: Each attribute in the following sections is annotated with one of the following keywords indicating support options for a conforming printer: Note that the title attribute of the Core collection is not applicable to the printed page since there is no place to display such supplementary information. A printer MAY ignore the content of the title element since it is not part of the document's body. The src attribute of the input element is not supported since the image type is not part of basic forms. This module adds the style attribute to the Common attribute collection (section 3.1). within the JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) and EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) files. [Informative] In traditional Web-based applications of XHTML, image data is contained in a separate file on a Web server that the user agent retrieves. This section is informative.

The participants at the time of publication were: This section describes behaviors of JPEG decoders for XHTML-Print conformant implementations. This section describes a RECOMMENDED color management approach for XHTML-Print printers. Sample values in a grayscale (single-component) JPEG image MAY be converted to the sRGB color space by setting or by other suitable algorithm specific to the XHTML-Print device. This section contains the pieces of the XHTML-Print DTD that are unique to XHTML-Print. The remaining entities and modules are as specified in reference [XHTMLMOD].

The DTD subset MUST NOT be used to override any parameter entities in the DTD. A conforming printer SHALL support all XHTML Modules listed in The XHTML-Print Document Type. A conforming printer SHALL print a static version of a form using default and selected values as specified in the form. The attribute applies to a user interface which is not represented on a printed page. For example, the accesskey attribute is irrelevant. The attribute applies to form submission which is not performed by the printer, the method attribute of the form element for example. The attribute, such as title, describes data which is not represented on a printed page The attribute applies to objects other than JPEG images, such as Java applets. The attribute does not apply since links specified by the anchor element are not followed. Embedded thumbnails Rotation Progressive rendering The User enters a URL into the Browser The Browser fetches the form from the Server and displays it The User enters data into the form The User asks the Browser to print the form The Browser composes a page with the form and the user data The Browser sends the newly composed form to the printer The User selects the Submit button on the form The Browser sends the user data to the Server The user then clicks on the browser's print button (step 4 of Sequence Diagram 1), to print the form as it currently appears. The browser sends (step 6 of Sequence Diagram 1) the document created in step 5 to the printer.

/+/ Ruminations on web development, standards, testing, life, and trying to do the right thing in a world where the right thing is rarely enough. Wednesday, July 17, 2013 Thursday, July 12, 2012 Tuesday, January 31, 2012 Wednesday, January 4, 2012 Thursday, December 22, 2011 Friday, December 17, 2010 Sunday, November 28, 2010  P.S. Yes, I forgot that I had this blog I should be updating.  My bad!  P.P.S.  Hooray for the Oxford Comma! Blog Archive About Me General information on RDFa at&nbsp;http://rdfa.info/ The RDFa Primer An interactive checker at&nbsp;http://rdfa.info/play/ Google's checker at&nbsp;http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets Help for creating licenses at&nbsp;http://creativecommons.org/choose/ Information on vocabularies at&nbsp;http://www.schema.org/ HTML 4.01 - last updated in 1999, but still the basis of most of the web. XHTML 1.0 - the first baby step toward a well-formed, valid web.  At its inception, we were all convinced that XML would rule the world, and HTML needed to be based upon XML if it was to survive.  We were a little bit wrong. XHTML Media Types - a Note that explained how to deliver the new XHTML documents to legacy user agents.  Still relevant and widely used today.  We have a small update for it that might still get published - you can see it here. XHTML Modularization - a set of building blocks and rules that language designers could use.  M12N is the basis for many activities within and outside of the W3C.  It continues to be used all over the place.  It started out being used only for XML DTDs, but was expanded to XML Schema (finally published recently, but complete for many years).  In the next weeks we will release a final installment of this, XHTML Modularization for RelaxNG. XML Events - a declarative way to define events and bind them to elements and observers.  It's first version was published by the XHTML activity.  It has now been taken over by the XForms activity.  I hope that they will get XML Events 2 out the door at some point. XHTML 1.1 - a tight, XML-centric version of XHTML based upon XHTML Modularization.  We published an update to this last week, but it is a stable grammar that can be used anywhere.  It is also the basis for many extended XHTML Grammars.  The update last week makes it possible to validate using XML Schema, and also to use the 'lang' attribute to improve use of XHTML 1.1 documents by assistive technologies. XHTML Basic - a version of XHTML targeted at the mobile community. XHTML Print - a version of XHTML targeted at rendering consistently on printers. XForms - an independent activity, but one that started within the XHTML activity. XHTML+RDFa - another independent activity.  Originally a joint task force of the XHTML2 and Semantic Web working groups.  The latest version builds up this early work, but continues to take advantage of XHTML Modularization for its definitions. CURIEs - a compact expression syntax for URIs.  Used by RDFa, but also potentially by other specifications that need to readily reference resources without using long URIs in attributes. The Role Attribute module - an independent module to add a role attribute.  Useful for accessibility, but also for general semantic notation.  This work has been taken on by the Protocols and Formats Working Group. The Access module - an independent module to add an access element.  This element would allow binding of 'keys' and events to elements.  The original module has no owner, but the general work has been picked up by the Protocols and Formats Working Group. XHTML 2 - a sweeping revision of XHTML.  This work was never completed, but will be published in its current state as a Note. XHTML Modularization 2.0 - an update to the modularization framework to accompany XHTML 2. XFrames - an improvement on traditional HTML framesets. XHTML 1.2 - a version of XHTML that added the role attribute, the access element, RDFa, and ARIA.  This was never a formal deliverable, but was a logical extension of the work. RDFa is (still) the best way to improve your SEO Xyzzy.  Nothing Happens.

/+/ &#xAE; W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, to host UK &amp; Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI, who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented, &#x201C;The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.&#x201D; Read more in our press release, and learn more about the W3C Offices program.  The W3C Advisory Committee has filled five open seats on the W3C Advisory Board. Created in 1998, the Advisory Board provides guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. Beginning 1 July 2016, the nine Advisory Board participants are Tantek &#xC7;elik (Mozilla), Michael Champion (Microsoft), Virginie Galindo (Gemalto), Jay (Junichi) Kishigami (NTT), Charles McCathie Nevile (Yandex), David Singer (Apple), L&#xE9;onie Watson (The Paciello Group), Chris Wilson (Google) and Judy Zhu (Alibaba). Many thanks to Soohong Daniel Park (Samsung Electronics), whose term ends this month. Read more about the Advisory Board. The Spatial Data on the Web Working Group has published a Working Draft of Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as &#x201C;SSN&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;SSNO&#x201D;) is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of &#x201C;just enough&#x201D; ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.  The Web Authentication Working Group has published a Working Draft of Web Authentication: A Web API for accessing scoped credentials. This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user&#x2019;s consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.  The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Level 1. The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can &#x201C;flex&#x201D; their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.  W3C has published new global guidelines, TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions 1.0 IMSC1 as a W3C Recommendation, that will improve accessibility and make it easier and less expensive for distributors of online video content to deliver subtitles and closed captions worldwide. An application of the W3C&#x2019;s Emmy&#xAE; award-winning Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), TTML Profiles for IMSC1 simplifies authoring and processing of subtitles and captions worldwide by harmonizing popular profiles of TTML. In addition, W3C&#x2019;s TTML Working Group updated the working draft of TTML 2, the second version of Timed Text Markup Language (TTML), which adds features introduced in IMSC1 as well as other improvements, such as additional support for East Asian language typography, stereoscopic presentations, and mapping to HTML and CSS. Described as a harmonization point for subtitling practices around the world, the IMSC1 global standard helps to bring together standards, rather than creating further fragmentation. Compatible with common media container formats, IMSC1 integrates with existing workflows, content libraries, and captioning requirements by offering conversion from popular captioning formats.
